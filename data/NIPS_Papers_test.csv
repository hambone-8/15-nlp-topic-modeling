1000,3667,2011,Probabilistic Modeling of Dependencies Among Visual Short-Term Memory Representations,"Extensive evidence suggests that items are not encoded independently in visual short-term memory (VSTM). However, previous research has not quantitatively considered how the encoding of an item influences the encoding of other items. Here, we model the dependencies among VSTM representations using a multivariate Gaussian distribution with a stimulus-dependent mean and covariance matrix. We report the results of an experiment designed to determine the specific form of the stimulus-dependence of the mean and the covariance matrix. We find that the magnitude of the covariance between the representations of two items is a monotonically decreasing function of the difference between the items' feature values, similar to a Gaussian process with a distance-dependent, stationary kernel function. We further show that this type of covariance function can be explained as a natural consequence of encoding multiple stimuli in a population of neurons with correlated responses."
1001,3668,2011,An Empirical Evaluation of Thompson Sampling,"Thompson sampling is one of oldest heuristic to address the exploration / exploitation trade-off, but it is surprisingly not very popular in the literature. We present here some empirical results using Thompson sampling on simulated and real data, and show that it is highly competitive. And since this heuristic is very easy to implement, we argue that it should be part of the standard baselines to compare against."
1002,3669,2011,Active learning of neural response functions with Gaussian processes,"A sizable literature has focused on the problem of estimating a low-dimensional feature space capturing a neuron's stimulus sensitivity.  However, comparatively little work has addressed the problem of estimating the nonlinear function from feature space to a neuron's output spike rate. Here, we use a Gaussian process (GP) prior over the infinite-dimensional space of nonlinear functions to obtain Bayesian estimates of the ""nonlinearity"" in the linear-nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) encoding model. This offers flexibility, robustness, and computational tractability compared to traditional methods (e.g., parametric forms, histograms, cubic splines).  Most importantly, we develop a framework for optimal experimental design based on uncertainty sampling.  This involves adaptively selecting stimuli to characterize the nonlinearity with as little experimental data as possible, and relies on a method for rapidly updating hyperparameters using the Laplace approximation.  We apply these methods to data from color-tuned neurons in macaque V1.  We estimate nonlinearities in the 3D space of cone contrasts, which reveal that V1 combines cone inputs in a highly nonlinear manner. With simulated experiments, we show that optimal design substantially reduces the amount of data required to estimate this nonlinear combination rule."
1003,3670,2011,Learning large-margin halfspaces with more malicious noise,"We describe a simple algorithm that runs in time  poly(n,1/gamma,1/eps) and learns an unknown n-dimensional  gamma-margin halfspace to accuracy 1-eps in the presence of  malicious noise, when the noise rate is allowed to be as high as  Theta(eps gamma sqrt(log(1/gamma))). Previous efficient  algorithms could only learn to accuracy eps in the presence of  malicious noise of rate at most Theta(eps gamma).    Our algorithm does not work by optimizing a convex loss function.  We  show that no algorithm for learning gamma-margin halfspaces that  minimizes a convex proxy for misclassification error can tolerate  malicious noise at a rate greater than Theta(eps gamma); this may  partially explain why previous algorithms could not achieve the higher  noise tolerance of our new algorithm."
1004,3671,2011,Multiple Instance Filtering,"We propose a robust filtering approach based on semi-supervised and multiple instance learning (MIL). We assume that the posterior density would be unimodal if not for the effect of outliers that we do not wish to explicitly model. Therefore, we seek for a point estimate at the outset, rather than a generic approximation of the entire posterior. Our approach can be thought of as a combination of standard finite-dimensional filtering (Extended Kalman Filter, or Unscented Filter) with multiple instance learning, whereby the initial condition comes with a putative set of inlier measurements. We show how both the state (regression) and the inlier set (classification) can be estimated iteratively and causally by processing only the current measurement. We illustrate our approach on visual tracking problems whereby the object of interest (target) moves and evolves as a result of occlusions and deformations, and partial knowledge of the target is given in the form of a bounding box (training set)."
1005,3672,2011,Lower Bounds for Passive and Active Learning,"We develop unified information-theoretic machinery for deriving lower bounds for passive and active learning schemes. Our bounds involve the so-called Alexander's capacity function. The supremum of this function has been recently rediscovered by Hanneke in the context of active learning under the name of ""disagreement coefficient."" For passive learning, our lower bounds match the upper bounds of Gine and Koltchinskii up to constants and generalize analogous results of Massart and Nedelec. For active learning, we provide first known lower bounds based on the capacity function rather than the disagreement coefficient."
1006,3673,2011,Learning Anchor Planes for Classification,"Local Coordinate Coding (LCC) [18] is a method for modeling functions of data lying on non-linear manifolds. It provides a set of anchor points which form a local coordinate system, such that each data point on the manifold can be approximated by a linear combination of its anchor points, and the linear weights become the local coordinate coding. In this paper we propose encoding data using orthogonal  anchor planes, rather than anchor points. Our method needs only a few orthogonal anchor planes for coding, and it can linearize any (\alpha,\beta,p)-Lipschitz smooth nonlinear  function with a fixed expected value of the upper-bound approximation error on any high dimensional data. In practice, the orthogonal coordinate system can be easily learned by minimizing this upper bound using singular value decomposition (SVD). We apply our method to model the coordinates locally in linear SVMs for classification tasks, and our experiment on MNIST shows that using only 50 anchor planes our method achieves 1.72% error rate, while LCC achieves 1.90% error rate using 4096 anchor points."
1007,3674,2011,Energetically Optimal Action Potentials,"Most action potentials in the nervous system take on the form of strong, rapid, and brief voltage deflections known as spikes, in stark contrast to other action potentials, such as in the heart, that are characterized by broad voltage plateaus. We derive the shape of the neuronal action potential from first principles, by postulating that action potential generation is strongly constrained by the brain's need to minimize energy expenditure. For a given height of an action potential, the least energy is consumed when the underlying currents obey the bang-bang principle: the currents giving rise to the spike should be intense, yet short-lived, yielding  spikes with sharp onsets and offsets. Energy optimality predicts features in the biophysics that are not per se required for producing the characteristic neuronal action potential:  sodium currents should be extraordinarily powerful and inactivate with voltage; both potassium and sodium currents should have kinetics that have a bell-shaped voltage-dependence; and the cooperative action of multiple `gates'  should start the flow of current."
1008,3676,2011,Practical Variational Inference for Neural Networks,"Variational methods have been previously explored as a tractable approximation to Bayesian inference for neural networks. However the approaches proposed so far have only been applicable to a few simple network architectures. This paper introduces an easy-to-implement stochastic variational method (or equivalently, minimum description length loss function) that can be applied to most neural networks. Along the way it revisits several common regularisers from a variational perspective. It also provides a simple pruning heuristic that can both drastically reduce the number of network weights and lead to improved generalisation. Experimental results are provided for a hierarchical multidimensional recurrent neural network applied to the TIMIT speech corpus."
1009,3678,2011,Variational Gaussian Process Dynamical Systems,"High dimensional time series are endemic in applications of machine learning  such as robotics (sensor data), computational biology (gene expression data), vision   (video sequences) and graphics (motion capture data). Practical nonlinear  probabilistic approaches to this data are required. In this paper we introduce  the variational Gaussian process dynamical system. Our work builds on recent  variational approximations for Gaussian process latent variable models to allow  for nonlinear dimensionality reduction simultaneously with learning a dynamical  prior in the latent space. The approach also allows for the appropriate dimensionality   of the latent space to be automatically determined. We demonstrate the  model on a human motion capture data set and a series of high resolution video  sequences."
1010,3679,2011,Unsupervised learning models of primary cortical receptive fields and receptive field plasticity,"The efficient coding hypothesis holds that neural receptive fields are adapted to the statistics of the environment, but is agnostic to the timescale of this adaptation, which occurs on both evolutionary and developmental timescales. In this work we focus on that component of adaptation which occurs during an organism's lifetime, and show that a number of unsupervised feature learning algorithms can account for features of normal receptive field properties across multiple primary sensory cortices. Furthermore, we show that the same algorithms account for altered receptive field properties in response to experimentally altered environmental statistics. Based on these modeling results we propose these models as phenomenological models of receptive field plasticity during an organism's lifetime. Finally, due to the success of the same models in multiple sensory areas, we suggest that these algorithms may provide a constructive realization of the theory, first proposed by Mountcastle (1978), that a qualitatively similar learning algorithm acts throughout primary sensory cortices."
1011,3680,2011,Multi-armed bandits on implicit metric spaces,"The multi-armed bandit (MAB) setting is a useful abstraction of many online learning tasks which focuses on the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. In this setting, an online algorithm has a fixed set of alternatives (""arms""), and in each round it selects one arm and then observes the corresponding reward. While the case of small number of arms is by now well-understood, a lot of recent work has focused on multi-armed bandits with (infinitely) many arms, where one needs to assume extra structure in order to make the problem tractable. In particular, in the Lipschitz MAB problem there is an underlying similarity metric space, known to the algorithm, such that any two arms that are close in this metric space have similar payoffs.  In this paper we consider the more realistic scenario in which the metric space is *implicit* -- it is defined by the available structure but not revealed to the algorithm directly. Specifically, we assume that an algorithm is given a tree-based classification of arms. For any given problem instance such a classification implicitly defines a similarity metric space, but the numerical similarity information is not available to the algorithm. We provide an algorithm for this setting, whose performance guarantees (almost) match the best known guarantees for the corresponding instance of the Lipschitz MAB problem."
1012,3681,2011,Comparative Analysis of Viterbi Training and Maximum Likelihood Estimation for HMMs,"We present an asymptotic analysis of Viterbi Training (VT) and contrast it with a more conventional Maximum Likelihood (ML) approach to parameter estimation in Hidden Markov Models. While ML estimator works by (locally) maximizing the likelihood of the observed data, VT seeks to maximize the probability of the most likely hidden state sequence. We develop an analytical framework based on a generating function formalism and illustrate it on an exactly solvable model of HMM with one unambiguous symbol. For this particular model the ML objective function is continuously degenerate. VT objective, in contrast, is shown to have only finite degeneracy. Furthermore, VT converges faster and results in sparser (simpler) models, thus realizing an automatic Occam's razor for HMM learning. For more general scenario VT can be worse compared to ML but still capable of correctly recovering most of the parameters."
1013,3682,2011,Sparse Filtering,"Unsupervised feature learning has been shown to be effective at learning representations that perform well on image, video and audio classification. However, many existing feature learning algorithms are hard to use and require extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we present sparse filtering, a simple new algorithm which is efficient and only has one hyperparameter, the number of features to learn.  In contrast to most other feature learning methods, sparse filtering does not explicitly attempt to construct a model of the data distribution. Instead, it optimizes a simple cost function -- the sparsity of L2-normalized features -- which can easily be implemented in a few lines of MATLAB code. Sparse filtering scales gracefully to handle high-dimensional inputs, and can also be used to learn meaningful features in additional layers with greedy layer-wise stacking. We evaluate sparse filtering on natural images, object classification (STL-10), and phone classification (TIMIT), and show that our method works well on a range of different modalities."
1014,3683,2011,Sparse Estimation with Structured Dictionaries,"In the vast majority of recent work on sparse estimation algorithms, performance has been evaluated using ideal or quasi-ideal dictionaries (e.g., random Gaussian or Fourier) characterized by unit $\ell_2$ norm, incoherent columns or features.  But in reality, these types of dictionaries represent only a subset of the dictionaries that are actually used in practice (largely restricted to idealized compressive sensing applications).  In contrast, herein sparse estimation is considered in the context of structured dictionaries possibly exhibiting high coherence between arbitrary groups of columns and/or rows.  Sparse penalized regression models are analyzed with the purpose of finding, to the extent possible, regimes of dictionary invariant performance.  In particular, a Type II Bayesian estimator with a dictionary-dependent sparsity penalty is shown to have a number of desirable invariance properties leading to provable advantages over more conventional penalties such as the $\ell_1$ norm, especially in areas where existing theoretical recovery guarantees no longer hold.  This can translate into improved performance in applications such as model selection with correlated features, source localization, and compressive sensing with constrained measurement directions."
1015,3684,2011,Dimensionality Reduction Using the Sparse Linear Model,"We propose an approach for linear unsupervised dimensionality reduction, based on the sparse linear model that has been used to probabilistically interpret sparse coding. We formulate an optimization problem for learning a linear projection from the original signal domain to a lower-dimensional one in a way that approximately preserves, in expectation, pairwise inner products in the sparse domain. We derive solutions to the problem, present nonlinear extensions, and discuss relations to compressed sensing. Our experiments using facial images, texture patches, and images of object categories suggest that the approach can improve our ability to recover meaningful structure in many classes of signals."
1016,3685,2011,Large-Scale Sparse Principal Component Analysis with Application to Text Data,"Sparse PCA provides a linear combination of small number of features that maximizes variance across data. Although Sparse PCA has apparent advantages compared to PCA, such as better interpretability, it is generally thought to be computationally much more expensive. In this paper, we demonstrate the surprising fact that sparse PCA can be easier than PCA in practice, and that it can be reliably applied to very large data sets. This comes from a rigorous feature elimination  pre-processing result, coupled with the favorable fact that features in real-life data typically have exponentially decreasing variances, which allows for many features to be eliminated. We introduce a fast block coordinate ascent algorithm with much better computational complexity than the existing first-order ones. We provide  experimental results obtained on text corpora involving millions of documents and hundreds of thousands of features. These results illustrate how Sparse PCA can help organize a large corpus of text data in a user-interpretable way, providing an attractive alternative approach to topic models."
1017,3686,2011,Rapid Deformable Object Detection using Dual-Tree Branch-and-Bound,"In this work we use Branch-and-Bound (BB) to efficiently detect objects with deformable part models.  Instead of evaluating the classifier score exhaustively over image locations and scales, we use BB to focus on promising image  locations.  The core problem is to compute bounds that accommodate part deformations; for this we adapt the Dual Trees data structure  to our problem.    We evaluate our approach using  Mixture-of-Deformable Part Models.  We obtain exactly the same results but are 10-20 times faster on average.  We also develop a multiple-object detection  variation of the system, where  hypotheses for 20 categories are inserted in a common   priority queue. For the problem of finding the strongest category in an image this results in up to a 100-fold speedup."
1018,3687,2011,Agnostic Selective Classification,"For a learning problem whose associated excess loss class is $(\beta,B)$-Bernstein, we show that it is theoretically possible to track the same classification performance  of the best (unknown) hypothesis in our class, provided that we are free to abstain from prediction in some region of our choice. The (probabilistic) volume of this rejected region of the domain is shown to be diminishing at rate $O(B\theta (\sqrt{1/m}))^\beta)$, where $\theta$ is Hanneke's disagreement coefficient. The strategy achieving this performance has computational barriers because it requires empirical error minimization in an agnostic setting. Nevertheless, we heuristically approximate this strategy and develop a novel selective classification algorithm  using constrained SVMs. We show empirically that the resulting algorithm consistently outperforms  the traditional rejection mechanism based on distance from decision boundary."
1019,3689,2011,Active Classification based on Value of Classifier,"Modern classification tasks usually involve many class labels and can be informed by a broad range of features. Many of these tasks are tackled by constructing a set of classifiers, which are then applied at test time and then pieced together in a fixed procedure determined in advance or at training time. We present an active classification process at the test time, where each classifier in a large ensemble is viewed as a potential observation that might inform our classification process. Observations are then selected dynamically based on previous observations, using a value-theoretic computation that balances an estimate of the expected classification gain from each observation as well as its computational cost. The expected classification gain is computed using a probabilistic model that uses the outcome from previous observations. This active classification process is applied at test time for each individual test instance, resulting in an efficient instance-specific decision path. We demonstrate the benefit of the active scheme on various real-world datasets, and show that it can achieve comparable or even higher classification accuracy at a fraction of the computational costs of traditional methods."
1020,3690,2011,Bayesian Partitioning of Large-Scale Distance Data,"A Bayesian approach to partitioning distance matrices is presented. It is inspired by the 'Translation-Invariant Wishart-Dirichlet' process (TIWD) in (Vogt et al., 2010) and shares a number of advantageous properties like the fully probabilistic nature of the inference model, automatic selection of the number of clusters and applicability in semi-supervised settings. In addition, our method (which we call 'fastTIWD') overcomes the main shortcoming of the original TIWD, namely its high computational costs. The fastTIWD reduces the workload in each iteration of a Gibbs sampler from O(n^3) in the TIWD to O(n^2). Our experiments show that this cost reduction does not compromise the quality of the inferred partitions. With this new method it is now possible to 'mine' large relational datasets with a probabilistic model, thereby automatically detecting new and potentially interesting clusters."
1021,3691,2011,Noise Thresholds for Spectral Clustering,"Although spectral clustering has enjoyed considerable empirical success in machine learning, its theoretical properties are not yet fully developed. We analyze the performance of a spectral algorithm for hierarchical clustering and show that on a class of hierarchically structured similarity matrices, this algorithm can tolerate noise that grows with the number of data points while still perfectly recovering the hierarchical clusters with high probability. We  additionally improve upon previous results for k-way spectral clustering to derive conditions under which spectral clustering makes no mistakes. Further, using minimax analysis, we derive tight upper and lower bounds for the  clustering problem and compare the performance of spectral clustering to these  information theoretic limits. We also present experiments on simulated and real  world data illustrating our results."
1022,3692,2011,The Fast Convergence of Boosting,"This manuscript considers the convergence rate of boosting under a large class of losses, including the exponential and logistic losses, where the best previous rate of convergence was O(exp(1/??)).  First, it is established that the setting of weak learnability aids the entire class, granting a rate O(ln(1/?)).  Next, the (disjoint) conditions under which the infimal empirical risk is attainable are characterized in terms of the sample and weak learning class, and a new proof is given for the known rate O(ln(1/?)).  Finally, it is established that any instance can be decomposed into two smaller instances resembling the two preceding special cases, yielding a rate O(1/?), with a matching lower bound for the logistic loss.  The principal technical hurdle throughout this work is the potential unattainability of the infimal empirical risk; the technique for overcoming this barrier may be of general interest."
1023,3693,2011,Global Solution of Fully-Observed Variational Bayesian Matrix Factorization is Column-Wise Independent,"Variational Bayesian matrix factorization (VBMF) efficiently   approximates the posterior distribution of factorized matrices   by assuming matrix-wise independence of the two factors.  A recent study on fully-observed VBMF  showed that, under a stronger assumption that the two factorized matrices are  column-wise independent,  the global optimal solution can be analytically computed.  However, it was not clear how restrictive  the column-wise independence assumption is.  In this paper, we prove that the global solution under matrix-wise  independence is actually column-wise independent,  implying that the column-wise independence assumption is harmless.  A practical consequence of our theoretical finding is that  the global solution under matrix-wise independence (which is a standard setup)  can be obtained analytically in a computationally very efficient way  without any iterative algorithms.  We experimentally illustrate advantages of using our analytic solution  in probabilistic principal component analysis."
1024,3694,2011,Structure Learning for Optimization,"We describe a family of global optimization procedures that automatically decompose optimization problems into smaller loosely coupled problems, then combine the solutions of these with message passing algorithms.  We show empirically that these methods excel in avoiding local minima and produce better solutions with fewer function evaluations than existing global optimization methods.  To develop these methods, we introduce a notion of coupling between variables of optimization that generalizes the notion of coupling that arises from factoring functions into terms that involve small subsets of the variables. It therefore subsumes the notion of independence between random variables in statistics, sparseness of the Hessian in nonlinear optimization, and the generalized distributive law. Despite being more general, this notion of coupling is easier to verify empirically -- making structure estimation easy -- yet it allows us to migrate well-established inference methods on graphical models to the setting of global optimization."
1025,3695,2011,Select and Sample - A Model of Efficient Neural Inference and Learning,"An increasing number of experimental studies indicate that perception encodes a posterior probability distribution over possible causes of sensory stimuli, which is used to act close to optimally in the environment. One outstanding difficulty with this hypothesis is that the exact posterior will in general be too complex to be represented directly, and thus neurons will have to represent an approximation of this distribution. Two influential proposals of efficient posterior representation by neural populations are: 1) neural activity represents samples of the underlying distribution, or 2) they represent a parametric representation of a variational approximation of the posterior. We show that these approaches can be combined for an inference scheme that retains the advantages of both: it is able to represent multiple modes and arbitrary correlations, a feature of sampling methods, and it reduces the represented space to regions of high probability mass, a strength of variational approximations. Neurally, the combined method can be interpreted as a feed-forward preselection of the relevant state space, followed by a neural dynamics implementation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to approximate the posterior over the relevant states. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of this approach on a sparse coding model. In numerical experiments on artificial data and image patches, we compare the performance of the algorithms to that of exact EM, variational state space selection alone, MCMC alone, and the combined select and sample approach. The select and sample approach integrates the advantages of the sampling and variational approximations, and forms a robust, neurally plausible, and very efficient model of processing and learning in cortical networks. For sparse coding we show applications easily exceeding a thousand observed and a thousand hidden dimensions."
1026,3696,2011,Large-Scale Category Structure Aware Image Categorization,"Most previous research on image categorization has focused on medium-scale data sets, while large-scale image categorization with millions of images from thousands of categories remains a challenge. With the emergence of structured large-scale dataset such as the ImageNet, rich information about the conceptual relationships between images, such as a tree hierarchy among various image categories, become available. As human cognition of complex visual world benefits from underlying semantic relationships between object classes, we believe a machine learning system can and should leverage such information as well for better performance. In this paper, we employ such semantic relatedness among image categories for large-scale image categorization. Specifically, a category hierarchy is utilized to properly define loss function and select common set of features for  related categories. An efficient optimization method based on proximal approximation and accelerated parallel gradient method is introduced. Experimental results on a subset of ImageNet containing 1.2 million images from 1000 categories demonstrate the effectiveness and promise of our proposed approach."
1027,3697,2011,On fast approximate submodular minimization,"We are motivated by an application to extract a representative subset of machine learning training data and by the poor empirical performance we observe of the popular minimum norm algorithm. In fact, for our application, minimum norm can have a running time of about O(n^7 ) (O(n^5 ) oracle calls). We therefore propose a fast approximate method to minimize arbitrary submodular functions. For a large sub-class of submodular functions, the algorithm is exact. Other submodular functions are iteratively approximated by tight submodular upper bounds, and then repeatedly optimized. We show theoretical properties, and empirical results suggest significant speedups over minimum norm while retaining higher accuracies."
1028,3698,2011,Sparse Recovery with Brownian Sensing,"We consider the problem of recovering the parameter alpha in R^K of a sparse function f, i.e. the number of non-zero entries of alpha is small compared to the number K of features, given noisy evaluations of f at a set of well-chosen sampling points. We introduce an additional randomisation process, called Brownian sensing, based on the computation of stochastic integrals, which produces a Gaussian sensing matrix, for which good recovery properties are proven independently on the number of sampling points N, even when the features are arbitrarily non-orthogonal. Under the assumption that f is H?lder continuous with exponent at least 1/2, we provide an estimate a of the parameter such that ||\alpha - a||_2 = O(||eta||_2\sqrt{N}), where eta is the observation noise. The method uses a set of sampling points uniformly distributed along a one-dimensional curve selected according to the features. We report numerical experiments illustrating our method."
1029,3700,2011,Shallow vs. Deep Sum-Product Networks,"We investigate the representational power of sum-product networks  (computation networks analogous to neural networks,  but whose individual units compute either products  or weighted sums), through a theoretical analysis that compares  deep (multiple hidden layers) vs. shallow (one hidden layer) architectures.  We prove there exist families of functions that can be represented  much more efficiently with a deep network than with a shallow one, i.e.  with substantially fewer hidden units.  Such results were not available until now, and  contribute to motivate recent research involving learning of deep  sum-product networks, and more generally motivate research in Deep  Learning."
1030,3701,2011,On Tracking The Partition Function,"Markov Random Fields (MRFs) have proven very powerful both as density estimators and feature extractors for classification. However, their use is often limited by an inability to estimate the partition function $Z$. In this paper, we exploit the gradient descent training procedure of restricted Boltzmann machines (a type of MRF) to {\bf track} the log partition function during learning. Our method relies on two distinct sources of information: (1) estimating the change $\Delta Z$ incurred by each gradient update, (2) estimating the difference in $Z$ over a small set of tempered distributions using bridge sampling. The two sources of information are then combined using an inference procedure similar to Kalman filtering.  Learning MRFs through Tempered Stochastic Maximum Likelihood, we can estimate $Z$ using no more temperatures than are required for learning. Comparing to both exact values and estimates using annealed importance sampling (AIS), we show on several datasets that our method is able to accurately track the log partition function. In contrast to AIS, our method provides this estimate at each time-step, at a computational cost similar to that required for training alone."
1031,3702,2011,Learning Probabilistic Non-Linear Latent Variable Models for Tracking Complex Activities,"A common approach for handling the complexity and inherent ambiguities of 3D human pose estimation is to use pose priors learned from  training data. Existing approaches however, are either too simplistic (linear), too complex to learn, or  can only learn latent spaces from ""simple data"", i.e., single activities such as walking or running. In this paper, we present an efficient stochastic gradient descent algorithm that is able to learn probabilistic non-linear latent  spaces composed of multiple  activities. Furthermore, we derive an incremental algorithm for the online setting which can update the latent space without extensive relearning. We demonstrate the  effectiveness of our approach on the  task of monocular and multi-view tracking and show that our approach  outperforms the state-of-the-art."
1032,3703,2011,Convergent Bounds on the Euclidean Distance,"Given a set V of n vectors in d-dimensional space, we provide an efficient method  for computing quality upper and lower bounds of the Euclidean distances between  a pair of the vectors in V . For this purpose, we define a distance measure, called  the MS-distance, by using the mean and the standard deviation values of vectors in  V . Once we compute the mean and the standard deviation values of vectors in V in  O(dn) time, the MS-distance between them provides upper and lower bounds of  Euclidean distance between a pair of vectors in V in constant time. Furthermore,  these bounds can be refined further such that they converge monotonically to the  exact Euclidean distance within d refinement steps. We also provide an analysis on  a random sequence of refinement steps which can justify why MS-distance should  be refined to provide very tight bounds in a few steps of a typical sequence. The  MS-distance can be used to various problems where the Euclidean distance is used  to measure the proximity or similarity between objects. We provide experimental  results on the nearest and the farthest neighbor searches."
1033,3704,2011,An ideal observer model for identifying the reference frame of objects,"The object people perceive in an image can depend on its orientation relative to the scene it is in (its reference frame). For example, the images of the symbols $\times$ and $+$ differ by a 45 degree rotation. Although real scenes have multiple images and reference frames, psychologists have focused on scenes with only one reference frame. We propose an ideal observer model based on nonparametric Bayesian statistics for inferring the number of reference frames in a scene and their parameters. When an ambiguous image could be assigned to two conflicting reference frames, the model predicts two factors should influence the reference frame inferred for the image: The image should be more likely to share the reference frame of the closer object ({\em proximity}) and it should be more likely to share the reference frame containing the most objects ({\em alignment}). We confirm people use both cues using a novel methodology that allows for easy testing of human reference frame inference."
1034,3705,2011,From Stochastic Nonlinear Integrate-and-Fire to Generalized Linear Models,"Variability in single neuron models is typically implemented either by a stochastic Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire model or by a model of the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) family. We use analytical and numerical methods to relate state-of-the-art models from both schools of thought. First we find the analytical expressions relating the subthreshold voltage from the Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire model (AdEx) to the Spike-Response Model with escape noise (SRM as an example of a GLM). Then we calculate numerically the link-function that provides the firing probability given a deterministic membrane potential. We find a mathematical expression for this link-function and test the ability of the GLM to predict the firing probability of a neuron receiving complex stimulation. Comparing the prediction performance of various link-functions, we find that a GLM with an exponential link-function provides an excellent approximation to the Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire with colored-noise input. These results help to understand the relationship between the different approaches to stochastic neuron models."
1035,3706,2011,A Machine Learning Approach to Predict Chemical Reactions,"Being able to predict the course of arbitrary chemical reactions is essential to the theory and applications of organic chemistry. Previous approaches are not high-throughput, are not generalizable or scalable, or lack sufficient data to be effective. We describe single mechanistic reactions as concerted electron movements from an electron orbital source to an electron orbital sink. We use an existing rule-based expert system to derive a dataset consisting of 2,989 productive mechanistic steps and 6.14 million non-productive mechanistic steps. We then pose identifying productive mechanistic steps as a ranking problem: rank potential orbital interactions such that the top ranked interactions yield the major products. The machine learning implementation follows a two-stage approach, in which we first train atom level reactivity filters to prune 94.0% of non-productive reactions with less than a 0.1% false negative rate. Then, we train an ensemble of ranking models on pairs of interacting orbitals to learn a relative productivity function over single mechanistic reactions in a given system. Without the use of explicit transformation patterns, the ensemble perfectly ranks the productive mechanisms at the top 89.1% of the time, rising to 99.9% of the time when top ranked lists with at most four non-productive reactions are considered. The final system allows multi-step reaction prediction. Furthermore, it is generalizable, making reasonable predictions over reactants and conditions which the rule-based expert system does not handle."
1036,3707,2011,How biased are maximum entropy models?,"Maximum entropy models have become popular statistical models in neuroscience and other areas in biology, and can be useful tools for obtaining estimates of mu- tual information in biological systems. However, maximum entropy models fit to small data sets can be subject to sampling bias; i.e. the true entropy of the data can be severely underestimated. Here we study the sampling properties of estimates of the entropy obtained from maximum entropy models. We show that if the data is generated by a distribution that lies in the model class, the bias is equal to the number of parameters divided by twice the number of observations. However, in practice, the true distribution is usually outside the model class, and we show here that this misspecification can lead to much larger bias. We provide a perturba- tive approximation of the maximally expected bias when the true model is out of model class, and we illustrate our results using numerical simulations of an Ising model; i.e. the second-order maximum entropy distribution on binary data."
1037,3708,2011,Gaussian process modulated renewal processes,"Renewal processes are generalizations of the Poisson process on the real line, whose intervals are drawn i.i.d. from some distribution. Modulated renewal processes allow these distributions to vary with time, allowing the introduction nonstationarity. In this work, we take a nonparametric Bayesian approach, modeling this nonstationarity with a Gaussian process. Our approach is based on the idea of uniformization, allowing us to draw exact samples from an otherwise intractable distribution. We develop a novel and efficient MCMC sampler for posterior inference. In our experiments, we test these on a number of synthetic and real datasets."
1038,3709,2011,Beating SGD: Learning SVMs in Sublinear Time,"We present an optimization approach for linear SVMs based on a stochastic primal-dual approach, where the primal step is akin to an importance-weighted SGD, and the dual step is a stochastic update on the importance weights.  This yields an optimization method with a sublinear dependence on the training set size, and the first method for learning linear SVMs with runtime less then the size of the training set required for learning!"
1039,3711,2011,Co-regularized Multi-view Spectral Clustering,"In many clustering problems, we have access to multiple views of the data each  of which could be individually used for clustering. Exploiting information from  multiple views, one can hope to find a clustering that is more accurate than the  ones obtained using the individual views. Since the true clustering would assign  a point to the same cluster irrespective of the view, we can approach this problem  by looking for clusterings that are consistent across the views, i.e., corresponding  data points in each view should have same cluster membership. We propose a  spectral clustering framework that achieves this goal by co-regularizing the clustering  hypotheses, and propose two co-regularization schemes to accomplish this.  Experimental comparisons with a number of baselines on two synthetic and three  real-world datasets establish the efficacy of our proposed approaches."
1040,3712,2011,Spatial distance dependent Chinese restaurant processes for image segmentation,"The distance dependent Chinese restaurant process (ddCRP) was recently introduced to accommodate random partitions of non-exchangeable data.  The ddCRP clusters data in a biased way: each data point is more likely to be clustered with other data that are near it in an external sense.  This paper examines the ddCRP in a spatial setting with the goal of natural image segmentation.  We explore the biases of the spatial ddCRP model and propose a novel hierarchical extension better suited for producing ""human-like"" segmentations. We then study the sensitivity of the models to various distance and appearance hyperparameters, and provide the first rigorous comparison of nonparametric Bayesian models in the image segmentation domain. On unsupervised image segmentation, we demonstrate that similar performance to existing nonparametric Bayesian models is possible with substantially simpler models and algorithms."
1041,3714,2011,Scalable Training of Mixture Models via Coresets,"How can we train a statistical mixture model on a massive data set? In this paper, we show how to construct coresets for mixtures of Gaussians and natural generalizations. A coreset is a weighted subset of the data, which guarantees that models fitting the coreset will also provide a good fit for the original data set. We show that, perhaps surprisingly, Gaussian mixtures admit coresets of size independent of the size of the data set. More precisely, we prove that a weighted set of $O(dk^3/\eps^2)$ data points suffices for computing a $(1+\eps)$-approximation for the optimal model on the original $n$ data points. Moreover, such coresets can be efficiently constructed in a map-reduce style computation, as well as in a streaming setting. Our results rely on a novel reduction of statistical estimation to problems in computational geometry, as well as new complexity results about mixtures of Gaussians. We empirically evaluate our algorithms on several real data sets, including a density estimation problem in the context of earthquake detection using accelerometers in  mobile phones."
1042,3715,2011,Two is better than one: distinct roles for familiarity and recollection in retrieving palimpsest memories,"Storing a new pattern in a palimpsest memory system comes at the cost of interfering with the memory traces of previously stored items. Knowing the age of a pattern thus becomes critical for recalling it faithfully. This implies that there should be a tight coupling between estimates of age, as a form of familiarity, and the neural dynamics of recollection, something which current theories omit. Using a normative model of autoassociative memory, we show that a dual memory system, consisting of two interacting modules for familiarity and recollection, has best performance for both recollection and recognition. This finding provides a new window onto actively contentious psychological and neural aspects of recognition memory."
1043,3716,2011,Infinite Latent SVM for Classification and Multi-task Learning,"Unlike existing nonparametric Bayesian models, which rely solely on specially conceived priors to incorporate domain knowledge for discovering improved latent representations, we study nonparametric Bayesian inference with regularization on the desired posterior distributions. While priors can indirectly affect posterior distributions through Bayes' theorem, imposing posterior regularization is arguably more direct and in some cases can be much easier. We particularly focus on developing infinite latent support vector machines (iLSVM) and multi-task infinite latent support vector machines (MT-iLSVM), which explore the large-margin idea in combination with a nonparametric Bayesian model for discovering predictive latent features for classification and multi-task learning, respectively. We present efficient inference methods and report empirical studies on several benchmark datasets. Our results appear to demonstrate the merits inherited from both large-margin learning and Bayesian nonparametrics."
1044,3717,2011,From Bandits to Experts: On the Value of Side-Observations,"We consider an adversarial online learning setting where a decision maker can choose an action in every stage of the game. In addition to observing the reward of the chosen action, the decision maker gets side observations on the reward he would have obtained had he chosen some of the other actions. The observation structure is encoded as a graph, where node i is linked to  node j if sampling i provides information on the reward of j. This setting naturally interpolates between the well-known ``experts'' setting, where the decision maker can view all rewards, and the multi-armed bandits setting, where the decision maker can only view the reward of the chosen action. We develop practical algorithms with provable regret guarantees, which depend on non-trivial graph-theoretic properties of the information feedback structure. We also provide partially-matching lower bounds."
1045,3718,2011,On Strategy Stitching in Large Extensive Form Multiplayer Games,"Computing a good strategy in a large extensive form game often demands an extraordinary amount of computer memory, necessitating the use of abstraction to reduce the game size.  Typically, strategies from abstract games perform better in the real game as the granularity of abstraction is increased.  This paper investigates two techniques for stitching a base strategy in a coarse abstraction of the full game tree, to expert strategies in fine abstractions of smaller subtrees.  We provide a general framework for creating static experts, an approach that generalizes some previous strategy stitching efforts.  In addition, we show that static experts can create strong agents for both 2-player and 3-player Leduc and Limit Texas Hold'em poker, and that a specific class of static experts can be preferred among a number of alternatives.  Furthermore, we describe a poker agent that used static experts and won the 3-player events of the 2010 Annual Computer Poker Competition."
1046,3719,2011,Facial Expression Transfer with Input-Output Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machines,"We present a type of Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine that defines a probability distribution over an output sequence conditional on an input sequence. It shares the desirable properties of RBMs: efficient exact inference, an exponentially more expressive latent state than HMMs, and the ability to model nonlinear structure and dynamics. We apply our model to a challenging real-world graphics problem: facial expression transfer. Our results demonstrate improved performance over several baselines modeling high-dimensional 2D and 3D data."
1047,3720,2011,An Unsupervised Decontamination Procedure For Improving The Reliability Of Human Judgments,"Psychologists have long been struck by individuals' limitations in expressing their internal sensations, impressions, and evaluations via rating scales.  Instead of using an absolute scale, individuals rely on reference points from recent experience.  This _relativity of judgment_ limits  the informativeness of responses on surveys, questionnaires, and evaluation forms. Fortunately, the cognitive processes that map stimuli to responses are not simply noisy, but rather are influenced by recent experience in a lawful manner.  We explore techniques to remove sequential dependencies, and thereby  _decontaminate_ a series of ratings to obtain more meaningful human  judgments.  In our formulation, the problem is to infer latent (subjective) impressions from a sequence of stimulus labels (e.g., movie names) and responses.  We describe an unsupervised approach that simultaneously recovers  the impressions and parameters of a contamination model that predicts how  recent judgments affect the current response.  We test our _iterated  impression inference_, or I^3, algorithm in three domains:  rating the gap between dots, the desirability of a movie based on an advertisement, and the morality of an action. We demonstrate significant objective improvements  in the quality of the recovered impressions."
1048,3722,2011,High-Dimensional Graphical Model Selection: Tractable Graph Families and Necessary Conditions,"We consider the problem of Ising and Gaussian graphical model selection given n i.i.d. samples from the model. We propose an efficient threshold-based algorithm   for structure estimation based known as  conditional mutual information test. This simple local algorithm    requires only low-order statistics of the data and decides    whether  two nodes   are neighbors in the unknown graph. Under some transparent assumptions, we establish that the proposed algorithm is structurally consistent (or sparsistent)  when the number of samples scales as n= Omega(J_{min}^{-4} log p), where p is the number of nodes and J_{min} is the minimum edge potential.  We also prove novel non-asymptotic necessary conditions for graphical model selection."
1049,3723,2011,Information Rates and Optimal Decoding in Large Neural Populations,"Many fundamental questions in theoretical neuroscience involve optimal  decoding and the computation of Shannon information rates in  populations of spiking neurons.  In this paper, we apply methods from  the asymptotic theory of statistical inference to obtain a clearer  analytical understanding of these quantities.  We find that for large  neural populations carrying a finite total amount of information, the  full spiking population response is asymptotically as informative as a  single observation from a Gaussian process whose mean and covariance  can be characterized explicitly in terms of network and single neuron  properties.  The Gaussian form of this asymptotic sufficient  statistic allows us in certain cases to perform optimal Bayesian  decoding by simple linear transformations, and to obtain closed-form  expressions of the Shannon information carried by the network.  One  technical advantage of the theory is that it may be applied easily  even to non-Poisson point process network models; for example, we find  that under some conditions, neural populations with strong  history-dependent (non-Poisson) effects carry exactly the same  information as do simpler equivalent populations of non-interacting  Poisson neurons with matched firing rates.  We argue that our findings  help to clarify some results from the recent literature on neural  decoding and neuroprosthetic design."
1050,3725,2011,Target Neighbor Consistent Feature Weighting for Nearest Neighbor Classification,"We consider feature selection and weighting for nearest neighbor classifiers. A technical challenge in this scenario is how to cope with the discrete update of nearest neighbors when the feature space metric is changed during the learning process. This issue, called the target neighbor change, was not properly addressed in the existing feature weighting and metric learning literature.  In this paper, we propose a novel feature weighting algorithm that can exactly and efficiently keep track of the correct target neighbors via sequential quadratic programming. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that guarantees the consistency between target neighbors and the feature space metric. We further show that the proposed algorithm can be naturally combined with regularization path tracking, allowing computationally efficient selection of the regularization parameter. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through experiments."
1051,3726,2011,On the Completeness of First-Order Knowledge Compilation for Lifted Probabilistic Inference,"Probabilistic logics are receiving a lot of attention today because of their expressive power for knowledge representation and learning. However, this expressivity is detrimental to the tractability of inference, when done at the propositional level.  To solve this problem, various lifted inference algorithms have been proposed that reason at the first-order level, about groups of objects as a whole. Despite the existence of various lifted inference approaches, there are currently no completeness results about these algorithms.  The key contribution of this paper is that we introduce a formal definition of lifted inference that allows us to reason about the completeness of lifted inference algorithms relative to a particular class of probabilistic models.  We then show how to obtain a completeness result using a first-order knowledge compilation approach for theories of formulae containing up to two logical variables."
1052,3727,2011,Data Skeletonization via Reeb Graphs,"Recovering hidden structure from complex and noisy non-linear data is one of the most fundamental problems in machine learning and statistical inference. While such data is often high-dimensional, it is of interest to approximate it with a low-dimensional or even one-dimensional space, since  many important aspects of  data are often intrinsically low-dimensional.   Furthermore, there are many scenarios where the underlying structure is graph-like, e.g, river/road networks or various trajectories.   In this paper, we develop a framework to extract, as well as to simplify, a one-dimensional ""skeleton"" from unorganized data using the Reeb graph.   Our algorithm is very simple, does not require complex optimizations and can be easily applied to unorganized high-dimensional data such as point clouds or  proximity graphs.   It can also represent arbitrary graph structures in the data.  We also give  theoretical results to justify our method.  We  provide a number of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our algorithm, including comparisons to existing methods, such as principal curves.  We believe that the simplicity and practicality of our algorithm will help to promote skeleton graphs as a data analysis tool for a broad range of applications."
1053,3728,2011,Differentially Private M-Estimators,This paper studies privacy preserving M-estimators using perturbed histograms. The proposed approach allows the release of a  wide class of M-estimators with both differential privacy and statistical utility without knowing a priori the particular inference procedure. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through a careful study of the convergence rates. A practical algorithm is given and applied on a real world data set containing both continuous and categorical  variables.
1054,3729,2011,Learning Eigenvectors for Free,"We extend the classical problem of predicting a sequence  of outcomes from a finite alphabet to the matrix domain.   In this extension, the alphabet of $n$ outcomes is replaced by the set of all dyads, i.e.   outer products $\u\u^\top$ where $\u$ is a vector in $\R^n$ of unit length.  Whereas in the classical case the goal is to learn   (i.e. sequentially predict as well as) the best multinomial distribution,  in the matrix case we desire to learn the density matrix  that best explains the observed sequence of dyads. We show  how popular online algorithms for learning a multinomial  distribution can be extended to learn density matrices.  Intuitively, learning the $n^2$ parameters of a density matrix is much harder than learning the $n$ parameters of a multinomial distribution. Completely surprisingly, we prove that the worst-case regrets of   certain classical algorithms and   their matrix generalizations are identical.   The reason is that the worst-case sequence of dyads share a common   eigensystem, i.e. the worst case regret is achieved in the  classical case. So these matrix algorithms learn the eigenvectors  without any regret."
1055,3730,2011,EigenNet: A Bayesian hybrid of generative and conditional models for sparse learning,"For many real-world applications, we often need to select correlated variables---such as genetic variations and imaging features associated with Alzheimer's disease---in a high dimensional space. The correlation between variables presents a challenge to classical variable selection methods. To address this challenge, the elastic net has been developed and successfully applied to many applications. Despite its great success, the elastic net does not exploit the correlation information embedded in the data to select correlated variables. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel hybrid model, EigenNet, that uses the eigenstructures of data to guide variable selection. Specifically, it integrates a sparse conditional classification model with a generative model capturing variable correlations in a principled Bayesian framework. We develop an efficient active-set algorithm to estimate the model via evidence maximization. Experiments on synthetic data and imaging genetics data demonstrated the superior predictive performance of the EigenNet over the lasso, the elastic net, and the automatic relevance determination."
1056,3731,2011,Reconstructing Patterns of Information Diffusion from Incomplete Observations,"Motivated by the spread of on-line information in general and   on-line petitions in particular, recent research has raised the following   combinatorial estimation problem.  There is a tree T that we cannot observe directly (representing  the structure along which the information has spread), and certain  nodes randomly decide to make their copy of the information public.  In the case of a petition, the list of names on each public copy   of the petition also reveals a path leading back to the root of the tree.  What can we conclude about the properties of the tree we observe  from these revealed paths,  and can we use the structure of the observed tree  to estimate the size of the full unobserved tree T?    Here we provide the first algorithm for this size estimation task,  together with provable guarantees on its performance.  We also establish structural properties of the observed tree, providing the  first rigorous explanation for some of the unusual structural  phenomena present in the spread of real chain-letter petitions  on the Internet."
1057,3733,2011,Expressive Power and Approximation Errors of Restricted Boltzmann Machines,"We present explicit classes of probability distributions that can be learned by Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) depending on the number of units that they contain, and which are representative for the expressive power of the model. We use this to show that the maximal Kullback-Leibler divergence to the RBM model with n visible and m hidden units is bounded from above by (n-1)-log(m+1). In this way we can specify the number of hidden units that guarantees a sufficiently rich model containing different classes of distributions and respecting a given error tolerance."
1058,3734,2011,Randomized Algorithms for Comparison-based Search,"This paper addresses the problem of finding the nearest neighbor (or    one of the $R$-nearest neighbors) of a query object $q$ in a    database of $n$ objects, when we can only use a comparison    oracle. The comparison oracle, given two reference objects and a    query object, returns the reference object most similar to the query    object.  The main problem we study is how to search the database for    the nearest neighbor (NN) of a query, while minimizing the    questions.  The difficulty of this problem depends on properties of    the underlying database. We show the importance of a    characterization: \emph{combinatorial disorder} $D$ which defines    approximate triangle inequalities on ranks. We present a lower bound    of $\Omega(D\log \frac{n}{D}+D^2)$ average number of questions in    the search phase for any randomized algorithm, which demonstrates    the fundamental role of $D$ for worst case behavior. We develop a    randomized scheme for NN retrieval in $O(D^3\log^2 n+ D\log^2 n    \log\log n^{D^3})$ questions.  The learning requires asking $O(n    D^3\log^2 n+ D \log^2 n \log\log n^{D^3})$ questions and    $O(n\log^2n/\log(2D))$ bits to store."
1059,3735,2011,A Collaborative Mechanism for Crowdsourcing Prediction Problems,"Machine Learning competitions such as the Netflix Prize have proven reasonably successful as a method of ?crowdsourcing? prediction tasks. But these compe- titions have a number of weaknesses, particularly in the incentive structure they create for the participants. We propose a new approach, called a Crowdsourced Learning Mechanism, in which participants collaboratively ?learn? a hypothesis for a given prediction task. The approach draws heavily from the concept of a prediction market, where traders bet on the likelihood of a future event. In our framework, the mechanism continues to publish the current hypothesis, and par- ticipants can modify this hypothesis by wagering on an update. The critical in- centive property is that a participant will profit an amount that scales according to how much her update improves performance on a released test set."
1060,3736,2011,Sequence learning with hidden units in spiking neural networks,"We consider a statistical framework in which recurrent networks of spiking neurons learn to generate spatio-temporal spike patterns. Given biologically realistic stochastic neuronal dynamics we derive a tractable learning rule for the synaptic weights towards hidden and visible neurons that leads to optimal recall of the training sequences. We show that learning synaptic weights towards hidden neurons significantly improves the storing capacity of the network. Furthermore, we derive an approximate online learning rule and show that our learning rule is consistent with Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity in that if a presynaptic spike shortly precedes a postynaptic spike, potentiation is induced and otherwise depression is elicited."
1061,3738,2011,Efficient Offline Communication Policies for Factored Multiagent POMDPs,"Factored Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (Dec-POMDPs) form a powerful framework for multiagent planning under uncertainty, but optimal solutions require a rigid history-based policy representation. In this paper we allow inter-agent communication which turns the problem in a centralized Multiagent POMDP (MPOMDP). We map belief distributions over state factors to an agent's local actions by exploiting structure in the joint MPOMDP policy.  The key point is that when sparse dependencies between the agents' decisions exist, often the belief over its local state factors is sufficient for an agent to unequivocally identify the optimal action, and communication can be avoided. We formalize these notions by casting the problem into convex optimization form, and present experimental results illustrating the savings in communication that we can obtain."
1062,3739,2011,Robust Lasso with missing and grossly corrupted observations,"This paper studies the problem of accurately recovering a sparse vector $\beta^{\star}$ from highly corrupted linear measurements $y = X \beta^{\star} + e^{\star} + w$ where $e^{\star}$ is a sparse error vector whose nonzero entries may be unbounded and $w$ is a bounded noise. We propose a so-called extended Lasso optimization which takes into consideration sparse prior information of both $\beta^{\star}$ and $e^{\star}$. Our first result shows that the extended Lasso can faithfully recover both the regression and the corruption vectors. Our analysis is relied on a notion of extended restricted eigenvalue for the design matrix $X$. Our second set of results applies to a general class of Gaussian design matrix $X$ with i.i.d rows $\oper N(0, \Sigma)$, for which we provide a surprising phenomenon: the extended Lasso can recover exact signed supports of both $\beta^{\star}$ and $e^{\star}$ from only $\Omega(k \log p \log n)$ observations, even the fraction of corruption is arbitrarily close to one. Our analysis also shows that this amount of observations required to achieve exact signed support is optimal."
1063,3740,2011,Variational Learning for Recurrent Spiking Networks,"We derive a plausible learning rule updating the synaptic efficacies   for feedforward, feedback and lateral connections between observed and latent neurons.    Operating in the context of a generative model for distributions of spike sequences,    the learning mechanism is derived from variational inference principles. The synaptic plasticity rules found   are interesting in that they are strongly reminiscent of experimentally found results on Spike Time    Dependent Plasticity, and in that they differ for excitatory and inhibitory neurons. A simulation   confirms the method's applicability to learning both stationary and temporal spike patterns."
1064,3741,2011,Prediction strategies without loss,"Consider a sequence of bits where we are trying to predict the next bit from the previous bits. Assume we are allowed to say `predict 0' or `predict 1', and our payoff is $+1$ if the prediction is correct and $-1$ otherwise. We will say that at each point in time the loss of an algorithm is the number of wrong predictions minus the number of right predictions so far.  In this paper we are interested in algorithms that have essentially zero (expected) loss over any string at any point in time and yet have small regret with respect to always predicting $0$ or always predicting $1$. For a sequence of length $T$ our algorithm has  regret $14\epsilon T $ and loss   $2\sqrt{T}e^{-\epsilon^2 T} $ in expectation for all strings. We show that the tradeoff between loss and regret is optimal up to constant factors.    Our techniques extend to the general setting of $N$ experts, where the related problem of trading off regret to the best expert for regret to the 'special' expert has been studied by Even-Dar et al. (COLT'07). We obtain essentially zero loss with respect to the special expert and optimal loss/regret tradeoff,  improving upon the results of Even-Dar et al (COLT'07) and settling the main question left open in their paper.     The strong loss bounds of the algorithm have some surprising consequences. First, we obtain a parameter free algorithm for the experts problem that has optimal regret bounds with respect to $k$-shifting optima, i.e. bounds with respect to the optimum that is allowed to change arms multiple times. Moreover, for {\em any window of size $n$} the regret of our algorithm to any expert never exceeds $O(\sqrt{n(\log N+\log T)})$, where $N$ is the number of experts and $T$ is the time horizon, while maintaining the essentially zero loss property."
1065,3742,2011,An Exact Algorithm for F-Measure Maximization,"The F-measure, originally introduced in information retrieval, is nowadays routinely used as a performance metric for problems such as binary classification, multi-label classification, and structured output prediction. Optimizing this measure remains a statistically and computationally challenging problem, since no closed-form maximizer exists. Current algorithms are approximate and typically rely on additional assumptions regarding the statistical distribution of the binary response variables. In this paper, we present an algorithm which is not only computationally efficient but also exact, regardless of the underlying distribution. The algorithm requires only a quadratic number of parameters of the joint distribution  (with respect to the number of binary responses). We illustrate its practical performance by means of experimental results for multi-label classification."
1066,3744,2011,Hogwild: A Lock-Free Approach to Parallelizing Stochastic Gradient Descent,"Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a popular algorithm that can achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of machine  learning tasks.  Several researchers have recently proposed schemes  to parallelize SGD, but all require  performance-destroying memory locking and synchronization. This work aims to show using novel theoretical analysis, algorithms,  and implementation that SGD can be implemented *without any locking*. We present an update scheme called Hogwild which allows processors access to shared memory with the possibility of overwriting each other's work. We show that when the associated optimization problem is sparse, meaning most gradient updates only modify small parts of the decision variable, then Hogwild achieves a nearly optimal rate of convergence.  We demonstrate experimentally that Hogwild outperforms alternative schemes that use locking by an order of magnitude."
1067,3745,2011,Learning unbelievable probabilities,"Loopy belief propagation performs approximate inference on graphical models with loops. One might hope to compensate for the approximation by adjusting model parameters. Learning algorithms for this purpose have been explored previously, and the claim has been made that every set of locally consistent marginals can arise from belief propagation run on a graphical model. On the contrary, here we show that many probability distributions have marginals that cannot be reached by belief propagation using any set of model parameters or any learning algorithm. We call such marginals `unbelievable.' This problem occurs whenever the Hessian of the Bethe free energy is not positive-definite at the target marginals. All learning algorithms for belief propagation necessarily fail in these cases, producing beliefs or sets of beliefs that may even be worse than the pre-learning approximation. We then show that averaging inaccurate beliefs, each obtained from belief propagation using model parameters perturbed about some learned mean values, can achieve the unbelievable marginals."
1068,3746,2011,Learning a Distance Metric from a Network,"Many real-world networks are described by both connectivity information and features for every node.  To better model and understand these networks, we present structure preserving metric learning (SPML), an algorithm for learning a Mahalanobis distance metric from a network such that the learned distances are tied to the inherent connectivity structure of the network.  Like the graph embedding algorithm structure preserving embedding, SPML learns a metric which is structure preserving, meaning a connectivity algorithm such as k-nearest neighbors will yield the correct connectivity when applied using the distances from the learned metric.  We show a variety of synthetic and real-world experiments where SPML predicts link patterns from node features more accurately than standard techniques.  We further demonstrate a method for optimizing SPML based on stochastic gradient descent which removes the running-time dependency on the size of the network and allows the method to easily scale to networks of thousands of nodes and millions of edges."
1069,3747,2011,Predicting response time and error rates in visual search,"A model of human visual search is proposed. It predicts both response time (RT) and error rates (RT) as a function of image parameters such as target contrast and clutter. The model is an ideal observer, in that it optimizes the Bayes ratio of tar- get present vs target absent. The ratio is computed on the firing pattern of V1/V2 neurons, modeled by Poisson distributions. The optimal mechanism for integrat- ing information over time is shown to be a ?soft max? of diffusions, computed over the visual field by ?hypercolumns? of neurons that share the same receptive field and have different response properties to image features. An approximation of the optimal Bayesian observer, based on integrating local decisions, rather than diffusions, is also derived; it is shown experimentally to produce very similar pre- dictions. A psychophyisics experiment is proposed that may discriminate between which mechanism is used in the human brain."
1070,3748,2011,Kernel Embeddings of Latent Tree Graphical Models,"Latent tree graphical models are natural tools for expressing long range and hierarchical dependencies among many variables which are common in computer vision, bioinformatics and natural language processing problems. However, existing models are largely restricted to discrete and Gaussian variables due to computational constraints; furthermore, algorithms for estimating the latent tree structure and learning the model parameters are largely restricted to heuristic local search. We present a method based on kernel embeddings of distributions for latent tree graphical models with continuous and non-Gaussian variables. Our method can recover the latent tree structures with provable guarantees and perform local-minimum free parameter learning and efficient inference. Experiments on simulated and real data show the advantage of our proposed approach."
1071,3749,2011,A Model for Temporal Dependencies in Event Streams,"We introduce the Piecewise-Constant Conditional Intensity Model, a model for learning temporal dependencies in event streams.  We describe a closed-form Bayesian approach to learning these models, and describe an importance sampling algorithm for forecasting future events using these models, using a proposal distribution based on Poisson superposition.  We then use synthetic data, supercomputer event logs, and web search query logs to illustrate that our learning algorithm can efficiently learn nonlinear temporal dependencies, and that our importance sampling algorithm can effectively forecast future events."
1072,3750,2011,Iterative Learning for Reliable Crowdsourcing Systems,"Crowdsourcing systems, in which tasks are electronically distributed to numerous ``information piece-workers'', have emerged as an effective paradigm for human-powered solving of large scale problems in domains such as image classification, data entry, optical character recognition, recommendation, and proofreading. Because these low-paid workers can be unreliable, nearly all crowdsourcers must devise schemes to increase confidence in their answers, typically by assigning each task multiple times and combining the answers in some way such as majority voting. In this paper, we consider a general model of such  rowdsourcing tasks, and pose the problem of minimizing the total price (i.e., number of task assignments) that must be paid to achieve a target overall reliability. We give new algorithms for deciding which tasks to assign to which workers and for inferring correct answers from the workers? answers. We show that our algorithm significantly outperforms majority voting and, in fact, are asymptotically optimal through comparison to an oracle that knows the reliability of every worker."
1073,3751,2011,A Global Structural EM Algorithm for a Model of Cancer Progression,"Cancer has complex patterns of progression that include converging as  well as diverging progressional pathways. Vogelstein's path model of  colon cancer was a pioneering contribution to cancer research.  Since  then, several attempts have been made at obtaining mathematical models  of cancer progression, devising learning algorithms, and applying  these to cross-sectional data. Beerenwinkel {\em et al.}  provided,  what they coined, EM-like algorithms for Oncogenetic Trees (OTs) and  mixtures of such. Given the small size of current and future data  sets, it is important to minimize the number of parameters of a  model. For this reason, we too focus on tree-based models and  introduce Hidden-variable Oncogenetic Trees (HOTs). In contrast to  OTs, HOTs allow for errors in the data and thereby provide more  realistic modeling. We also design global structural EM algorithms for  learning HOTs and mixtures of HOTs (HOT-mixtures). The algorithms are  global in the sense that, during the M-step, they find a structure  that yields a global maximum of the expected complete log-likelihood  rather than merely one that improves it. The algorithm for single HOTs  performs very well on reasonable-sized data sets, while that for  HOT-mixtures requires data sets of sizes obtainable only with  tomorrow's more cost-efficient technologies."
1074,3752,2011,Semi-supervised Regression via Parallel Field Regularization,"This paper studies the problem of semi-supervised learning from the vector field perspective. Many of the existing work use the graph Laplacian to ensure the smoothness of the prediction function on the data manifold. However, beyond smoothness, it is suggested by recent theoretical work that we should ensure second order smoothness for achieving faster rates of convergence for semi-supervised regression problems. To achieve this goal, we show that the second order smoothness measures the linearity of the function, and the gradient field of a linear function has to be a parallel vector field. Consequently, we propose to find a function which minimizes the empirical error, and simultaneously requires its gradient field to be as parallel as possible. We give a continuous objective function on the manifold and discuss how to discretize it by using random points. The discretized optimization problem turns out to be a sparse linear system which can be solved very efficiently. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed approach."
1075,3753,2011,Metric Learning with Multiple Kernels,"Metric learning has become a very active research field. The most popular representative--Mahalanobis metric learning--can be seen as learning a linear transformation and then computing the Euclidean metric in the transformed space. Since a linear transformation might not always be appropriate for a given learning problem, kernelized versions of various metric learning algorithms exist. However, the problem then becomes finding the appropriate kernel function. Multiple kernel learning addresses this limitation by learning a linear combination of a number of predefined kernels; this approach can be also readily used in the context of multiple-source learning to fuse different data sources. Surprisingly, and despite the extensive work on multiple kernel learning for SVMs, there has been no work in   the area of metric learning with multiple kernel learning. In this paper we fill this gap and present a general approach for metric learning with multiple kernel learning. Our approach can be instantiated with different metric learning algorithms provided that they satisfy some constraints. Experimental evidence suggests that our approach outperforms metric learning with an unweighted kernel combination and metric learning with cross-validation based kernel selection."
1076,3757,2011,On the Analysis of Multi-Channel Neural Spike Data,"Nonparametric Bayesian methods are developed for analysis of multi-channel  spike-train data, with the feature learning and spike sorting performed jointly.  The feature learning and sorting are performed simultaneously across all channels.  Dictionary learning is implemented via the beta-Bernoulli process, with  spike sorting performed via the dynamic hierarchical Dirichlet process (dHDP),  with these two models coupled. The dHDP is augmented to eliminate refractoryperiod  violations, it allows the ?appearance? and ?disappearance? of neurons over  time, and it models smooth variation in the spike statistics."
1077,3758,2011,RTRMC: A Riemannian trust-region method for low-rank matrix completion,"We consider large matrices of low rank. We address the problem of recovering such matrices when most of the entries are unknown. Matrix completion finds applications in recommender systems. In this setting, the rows of the matrix may correspond to items and the columns may correspond to users. The known entries are the ratings given by users to some items. The aim is to predict the unobserved ratings. This problem is commonly stated in a constrained optimization framework. We follow an approach that exploits the geometry of the low-rank constraint to recast the problem as an unconstrained optimization problem on the Grassmann manifold. We then apply first- and second-order Riemannian trust-region methods to solve it. The cost of each iteration is linear in the number of known entries. Our methods, RTRMC 1 and 2, outperform state-of-the-art algorithms on a wide range of problem instances."
1078,3759,2011,Hashing Algorithms for Large-Scale Learning,"Minwise hashing is a standard technique in the context of search for efficiently computing set similarities. The recent development of b-bit minwise hashing provides a  substantial improvement by storing only the lowest b bits of each hashed value. In this paper, we demonstrate that  b-bit minwise hashing can be naturally integrated with linear learning algorithms such as linear SVM and logistic regression, to solve large-scale and high-dimensional statistical learning tasks, especially when the data do not fit in memory.   We  compare $b$-bit minwise hashing with  the Count-Min (CM)  and  Vowpal Wabbit (VW) algorithms, which have essentially the same variances as random projections. Our theoretical and empirical comparisons illustrate that b-bit minwise hashing is significantly more accurate (at the same storage cost) than VW (and random projections) for binary data."
1079,3760,2011,Neuronal Adaptation for Sampling-Based Probabilistic Inference in Perceptual Bistability,"It has been argued that perceptual multistability reflects probabilistic inference performed by the brain when sensory input is ambiguous. Alternatively, more traditional explanations of multistability refer to low-level mechanisms such as neuronal adaptation. We employ a Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM) model of cortical processing to demonstrate that these two different approaches can be combined in the same framework. Based on recent developments in machine learning, we show how neuronal adaptation can be understood as a mechanism that improves probabilistic, sampling-based inference. Using the ambiguous Necker cube image, we analyze the perceptual switching exhibited by the model. We also examine the influence of spatial attention, and explore how binocular rivalry can be modeled with the same approach. Our work joins earlier studies in demonstrating how the principles underlying DBMs relate to cortical processing, and offers novel perspectives on the neural implementation of approximate probabilistic inference in the brain."
1080,3761,2011,Thinning Measurement Models and Questionnaire Design,"Inferring key unobservable features of individuals is an important task in the applied sciences. In particular, an important source of data in fields such as marketing, social sciences and medicine is questionnaires: answers in such questionnaires are noisy measures of target unobserved features. While comprehensive surveys help to better estimate the latent variables of interest, aiming at a high number of questions comes at a price: refusal to participate in surveys can go up, as well as the rate of missing data; quality of answers can decline; costs associated with applying such questionnaires can also increase. In this paper, we cast the problem of refining existing models for questionnaire data as follows: solve a constrained optimization problem of preserving the maximum amount of information found in a latent variable model using only a subset of existing questions. The goal is to find an optimal subset of a given size. For that, we first define an information theoretical measure for quantifying the quality of a reduced questionnaire. Three different approximate inference methods are introduced to solve this problem. Comparisons against a simple but powerful heuristic are presented."
1081,3762,2011,Higher-Order Correlation Clustering for Image Segmentation,"For many of the state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms, image segmentation is an important preprocessing step. As such, several image segmentation algorithms have been proposed, however, with certain reservation due to high computational load and many hand-tuning parameters. Correlation clustering, a graph-partitioning algorithm often used in natural language processing and document clustering, has the potential to perform better than previously proposed image segmentation algorithms. We improve the basic correlation clustering formulation by taking into account higher-order cluster relationships. This improves clustering in the presence of local boundary ambiguities. We first apply the pairwise correlation clustering to image segmentation over a pairwise superpixel graph and then develop higher-order correlation clustering over a hypergraph that considers higher-order relations among superpixels. Fast inference is possible by linear programming relaxation, and also effective parameter learning framework by structured support vector machine is possible. Experimental results on various datasets show that the proposed higher-order correlation clustering outperforms other state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms."
1082,3763,2011,Non-conjugate Variational Message Passing for Multinomial and Binary Regression,"Variational Message Passing (VMP) is an algorithmic implementation of the Variational Bayes (VB) method which applies only in the special case of conjugate exponential family models. We propose an extension to VMP, which we refer to as Non-conjugate Variational Message Passing (NCVMP) which aims to alleviate this restriction while maintaining modularity, allowing choice in how expectations are calculated, and integrating into an existing message-passing framework: Infer.NET. We demonstrate NCVMP on logistic binary and multinomial regression. In the multinomial case we introduce a novel variational bound for the softmax factor which is tighter than other commonly used bounds whilst maintaining computational tractability."
1083,3764,2011,Learning to Search Efficiently in High Dimensions,"High dimensional similarity search in large scale databases becomes an important challenge due to the advent of Internet. For such applications, specialized data structures are required to achieve computational efficiency. Traditional approaches relied on algorithmic constructions that are often data independent (such as Locality Sensitive Hashing) or weakly dependent (such as kd-trees, k-means trees). While supervised learning algorithms have been applied to related problems, those proposed in the literature mainly focused on learning hash codes optimized for compact embedding of the data rather than search efficiency. Consequently such an embedding has to be used with linear scan or another search algorithm. Hence learning to hash does not directly address the search efficiency issue. This paper considers a new framework that applies supervised learning to directly optimize a data structure that supports efficient large scale search. Our approach takes both search quality and computational cost into consideration. Specifically, we learn a boosted search forest that is optimized using pair-wise similarity labeled examples. The output of this search forest can be efficiently converted into an inverted indexing data structure, which can leverage modern text search infrastructure to achieve both scalability and efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the start-of-the-art learning to hash methods (such as spectral hashing), as well as state-of-the-art high dimensional search algorithms (such as LSH and k-means trees)."
1084,3767,2011,Optimal Reinforcement Learning for Gaussian Systems,"The exploration-exploitation trade-off is among the central challenges of reinforcement learning. The optimal Bayesian solution is intractable in general. This paper studies to what extent analytic statements about optimal learning are possible if all beliefs are Gaussian processes. A first order approximation of learning of both loss and dynamics, for nonlinear, time-varying systems in continuous time and space, subject to a relatively weak restriction on the dynamics, is described by an infinite-dimensional partial differential equation. An approximate finite-dimensional projection gives an impression for how this result may be helpful."
1085,3768,2011,Bayesian Spike-Triggered Covariance Analysis,"Neurons typically respond to a restricted number of stimulus features within the high-dimensional space of natural stimuli. Here we describe an explicit model-based interpretation of traditional estimators for a neuron's multi-dimensional feature space, which allows for several important generalizations and extensions. First, we show that traditional estimators based on the spike-triggered average (STA) and spike-triggered covariance (STC) can be formalized in terms of the ""expected log-likelihood"" of a Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) model with Gaussian stimuli. This model-based formulation allows us to define maximum-likelihood and Bayesian estimators that are statistically consistent and efficient in a wider variety of settings, such as with naturalistic (non-Gaussian) stimuli. It also allows us to employ Bayesian methods for regularization, smoothing, sparsification, and model comparison, and provides Bayesian confidence intervals on model parameters. We describe an empirical Bayes method for selecting the number of features, and extend the model to accommodate an arbitrary elliptical nonlinear response function, which results in a more powerful and more flexible model for feature space inference. We validate these methods using neural data recorded extracellularly from macaque primary visual cortex."
1086,3769,2011,Greedy Algorithms for Structurally Constrained High Dimensional Problems,"A hallmark of modern machine learning is its ability to deal with high dimensional problems by exploiting structural assumptions that limit the degrees of freedom in the underlying model.  A deep understanding of the capabilities and limits of high dimensional learning methods under specific assumptions such as sparsity, group sparsity, and low rank has been attained.  Efforts (Negahban et al., 2010, Chandrasekaran et al., 2010} are now underway to distill this valuable experience by proposing general unified frameworks that can achieve the twin goals of summarizing previous analyses and enabling their application to notions of structure hitherto unexplored. Inspired by these developments, we propose and analyze a general computational scheme based on a greedy strategy to solve convex optimization problems that arise when dealing with structurally constrained high-dimensional problems. Our framework not only unifies existing greedy algorithms by recovering them as special cases but also yields novel ones. Finally, we extend our results to infinite dimensional problems by using interesting connections between smoothness of norms and behavior of martingales in Banach spaces."
1087,3770,2011,On the Universality of Online Mirror Descent,"We show that for a general class of convex online learning  problems, Mirror Descent can always achieve a (nearly) optimal regret guarantee."
1088,3771,2011,Kernel Bayes' Rule,"A nonparametric kernel-based method for realizing Bayes' rule is proposed, based on kernel representations of probabilities in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The prior and conditional probabilities are expressed as empirical kernel mean and covariance operators, respectively, and the kernel mean of the posterior distribution is computed in the form of a weighted sample.  The kernel Bayes' rule can be applied to a wide variety of Bayesian inference problems: we demonstrate Bayesian computation without likelihood, and filtering with a nonparametric state-space model. A consistency rate for the posterior estimate is established."
1089,3772,2011,Selecting the State-Representation in Reinforcement Learning,"The problem of selecting the right state-representation in a reinforcement learning problem is considered.   Several models (functions mapping past observations to a finite set) of the observations are given, and it is known   that for at least one of these models the resulting state dynamics are indeed Markovian. Without  knowing neither which of the models is the correct one, nor what are the probabilistic characteristics of the resulting   MDP, it is required to obtain as much reward as the optimal policy for the correct model (or for the best of the correct models, if there are several). We propose an algorithm that achieves that,   with a regret of order T^{2/3} where T is the horizon time."
1090,3773,2011,A blind sparse deconvolution method for neural spike identification,"We consider the problem of estimating neural spikes from extracellular voltage recordings. Most current methods are based on clustering, which requires substantial human supervision and produces systematic errors by failing to properly handle temporally overlapping spikes. We formulate the problem as one of statistical inference, in which the recorded voltage is a noisy sum of the spike trains of each neuron convolved with its associated spike waveform.  Joint maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimation of the waveforms and spikes is then a blind deconvolution problem in which the coefficients are sparse. We develop a block-coordinate descent method for approximating the MAP solution.  We validate our method on data simulated according to the generative model, as well as on real data for which ground truth is available via simultaneous intracellular recordings. In both cases, our method substantially reduces the number of missed spikes and false positives when compared to a standard clustering algorithm, primarily by recovering temporally overlapping spikes.  The method offers a fully automated alternative to clustering methods that is less susceptible to systematic errors."
1091,3774,2011,Improved Algorithms for Linear Stochastic Bandits,"We improve the theoretical analysis and empirical performance of algorithms for the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem and the linear stochastic multi-armed bandit problem. In particular, we show that a simple modification of Auer?s UCB algorithm (Auer, 2002) achieves with high probability constant regret. More importantly, we modify and, consequently, improve the analysis of the algorithm for the for linear stochastic bandit problem studied by Auer (2002), Dani et al. (2008), Rusmevichientong and Tsitsiklis (2010), Li et al. (2010). Our modification improves the regret bound by a logarithmic factor, though experiments show a vast improvement. In both cases, the improvement stems from the construction of smaller confidence sets. For their construction we use a novel tail inequality for vector-valued martingales."
1092,3775,2011,<var>\theta</var>,"For most scene understanding tasks (such as object detection or depth estimation), the classifiers need to consider contextual information in addition to the local features. We can capture such contextual information by taking as input the features/attributes from all the regions in the image. However, this contextual dependence also varies with the spatial location of the region of interest, and we therefore need a different set of parameters for each spatial location. This results in a very large number of parameters. In this work, we model the independence properties between the parameters for each location and for each task, by defining a Markov Random Field (MRF) over the parameters. In particular, two sets of parameters are encouraged to have similar values if they are spatially close or semantically close. Our method is, in principle, complementary to other ways of capturing context such as the ones that use a graphical model over the labels instead. In extensive evaluation over two different settings, of multi-class object detection and of multiple scene understanding tasks (scene categorization, depth estimation, geometric labeling), our method beats the state-of-the-art methods in all the four tasks."
1093,3778,2011,Nonlinear Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Gaussian Processes,"We present a probabilistic algorithm for nonlinear inverse reinforcement learning. The goal of inverse reinforcement learning is to learn the reward function in a Markov decision process from expert demonstrations. While most prior inverse reinforcement learning algorithms represent the reward as a linear combination of a set of features, we use Gaussian processes to learn the reward as a nonlinear function, while also determining the relevance of each feature to the expert's policy. Our probabilistic algorithm allows complex behaviors to be captured from suboptimal stochastic demonstrations, while automatically balancing the simplicity of the learned reward structure against its consistency with the observed actions."
1094,3779,2011,A Convergence Analysis of Log-Linear Training,"Log-linear models are widely used probability models for statistical pattern recognition. Typically, log-linear models are trained according to a convex criterion. In recent years, the interest in log-linear models has greatly increased. The optimization of log-linear model parameters is costly and therefore an important topic, in particular for large-scale applications. Different optimization algorithms have been evaluated empirically in many papers. In this work, we analyze the optimization problem analytically and show that the training of log-linear models can be highly ill-conditioned. We verify our findings on two handwriting tasks. By making use of our convergence analysis, we obtain good results on a large-scale continuous handwriting recognition task with a simple and generic approach."
1095,3780,2011,Uniqueness of Belief Propagation on Signed Graphs,"While loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) has been utilized in a wide variety of applications with empirical success, it comes with few theoretical guarantees. Especially, if the interactions of random variables in a graphical model are strong, the behaviors of the algorithm can be difficult to analyze due to underlying phase transitions. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to the uniqueness problem of the LBP fixed point; our new ?necessary and sufficient? condition is stated in terms of graphs and signs, where the sign denotes the types (attractive/repulsive) of the interaction (i.e., compatibility function) on the edge. In all previous works, uniqueness is guaranteed only in the situations where the strength of the interactions are ?sufficiently? small in certain senses. In contrast, our condition covers arbitrary strong interactions on the specified class of signed graphs. The result of this paper is based on the recent theoretical advance in the LBP algorithm; the connection with the graph zeta function."
1096,3781,2011,Inductive reasoning about chimeric creatures,"Given one feature of a novel animal, humans readily make inferences about other features of the animal. For example, winged creatures often fly, and creatures that eat fish often live in the water. We explore the knowledge that supports these inferences and compare two approaches. The first approach proposes that humans rely on abstract representations of dependency relationships between features, and is formalized here as a graphical model.  The second approach proposes that humans rely on specific knowledge of previously encountered animals, and is formalized here as a family of exemplar models. We evaluate these models using a task where participants reason about chimeras, or animals with pairs of features that have not previously been observed to co-occur. The results support the hypothesis that humans rely on explicit representations of relationships between features."
1097,3782,2011,On Causal Discovery with Cyclic Additive Noise Models,"We study a particular class of cyclic causal models, where each variable is a (possibly nonlinear) function of its parents and additive noise. We prove that the causal graph of such models is generically identifiable in the bivariate, Gaussian-noise case. We also propose a method to learn such models from observational data. In the acyclic case, the method reduces to ordinary regression, but in the more challenging cyclic case, an additional term arises in the loss function, which makes it a special case of nonlinear independent component analysis. We illustrate the proposed method on synthetic data."
1098,3783,2011,Nearest Neighbor based Greedy Coordinate Descent,"Increasingly, optimization problems in machine learning, especially those arising from high-dimensional statistical estimation, have a large number of variables. Modern statistical estimators developed over the past decade have statistical or sample complexity that depends only weakly on the number of parameters when there is some structure to the problem, such as sparsity. A central question is whether similar advances can be made in their computational complexity as well. In this paper, we propose strategies that indicate that such advances can indeed be made. In particular, we investigate the greedy coordinate descent algorithm, and note that performing the greedy step efficiently weakens the costly dependence on the problem size provided the solution is sparse. We then propose a suite of methods that perform these greedy steps efficiently by a reduction to nearest neighbor search.   We also devise a more amenable form of greedy descent for composite non-smooth objectives; as well as several approximate variants of such greedy descent. We develop a practical implementation of our algorithm that combines greedy coordinate descent with locality sensitive hashing. Without tuning the latter data structure, we are not only able to significantly speed up the vanilla greedy method, but also outperform cyclic descent when the problem size becomes large. Our results indicate the effectiveness of our nearest neighbor strategies, and also point to many open questions regarding the development of computational geometric techniques tailored towards first-order optimization methods."
1099,3784,2011,Structural equations and divisive normalization for energy-dependent component analysis,"Components estimated by independent component analysis and related methods  are typically not independent in real data. A very common form of nonlinear  dependency between the components is correlations in their variances or ener-  gies. Here, we propose a principled probabilistic model to model the energy-  correlations between the latent variables. Our two-stage model includes a linear  mixing of latent signals into the observed ones like in ICA. The main new fea-  ture is a model of the energy-correlations based on the structural equation model  (SEM), in particular, a Linear Non-Gaussian SEM. The SEM is closely related to  divisive normalization which effectively reduces energy correlation. Our new two-  stage model enables estimation of both the linear mixing and the interactions re-  lated to energy-correlations, without resorting to approximations of the likelihood  function or other non-principled approaches. We demonstrate the applicability of  our method with synthetic dataset, natural images and brain signals."
1100,3785,2011,Active Ranking using Pairwise Comparisons,"This paper examines the problem of ranking a collection of objects using pairwise comparisons (rankings of two objects).  In general, the ranking of $n$ objects can be identified by standard sorting methods using $n\log_2 n$ pairwise comparisons. We are interested in natural situations in which relationships among the objects may allow for ranking using far fewer pairwise comparisons. {Specifically, we assume that the objects can be embedded into a $d$-dimensional Euclidean space and that the rankings reflect their relative distances from a common reference point in $\R^d$. We show that under this assumption the number of possible rankings grows like $n^{2d}$ and demonstrate an algorithm that can identify a randomly selected ranking using just slightly more than $d\log n$ adaptively selected pairwise comparisons, on average.}  If instead the comparisons are chosen at random, then almost all pairwise comparisons must be made in order to identify any ranking. In addition, we propose a robust, error-tolerant algorithm that only requires that the pairwise comparisons are probably correct. Experimental studies with synthetic and real datasets support the conclusions of our theoretical analysis."
1101,3786,2011,Active Learning Ranking from Pairwise Preferences with Almost Optimal Query Complexity,"Given a set $V$ of  $n$ elements we wish to linearly order them using pairwise preference labels  which may be non-transitive (due to irrationality or arbitrary noise).  The goal is to linearly order the elements while disagreeing with  as few pairwise preference labels as possible.  Our performance is measured by two parameters:  The number of disagreements (loss) and the query complexity (number of pairwise preference labels).  Our algorithm adaptively queries  at most $O(n\poly(\log n,\eps^{-1}))$ preference labels for a regret of  $\eps$ times the optimal loss.  This is strictly better, and often significantly better than what  non-adaptive sampling could achieve.  Our main result helps settle an open problem posed by   learning-to-rank (from pairwise information) theoreticians and practitioners:  What is a provably correct way to sample preference labels?"
1102,3787,2011,Efficient Learning of Generalized Linear and Single Index Models with Isotonic Regression,"Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and Single Index Models (SIMs) provide powerful generalizations of linear regression, where the target variable is assumed to be a (possibly unknown) 1-dimensional function of a linear predictor. In general, these problems entail non-convex estimation procedures, and, in practice, iterative local search heuristics are often used.  Kalai and Sastry (2009) provided the first provably efficient method, the \emph{Isotron} algorithm, for learning SIMs and GLMs, under the assumption that the data is in fact generated under a GLM and under certain monotonicity and Lipschitz (bounded slope) constraints. The Isotron algorithm interleaves steps of perceptron-like updates with isotonic regression (fitting a one-dimensional non-decreasing function). However, to obtain provable performance, the method requires a fresh sample every iteration. In this paper, we provide algorithms for learning GLMs and SIMs, which are both computationally and statistically efficient. We modify the isotonic regression step in Isotron to fit a Lipschitz monotonic function, and also provide an efficient $O(n \log(n))$ algorithm for this step, improving upon the previous $O(n^2)$ algorithm. We provide a brief empirical study, demonstrating the feasibility of our algorithms in practice."
1103,3789,2011,A concave regularization technique for sparse mixture models,"Latent variable mixture models are a powerful tool for exploring the structure in large datasets. A common challenge for interpreting such models is a desire to impose sparsity, the natural assumption that each data point only contains few latent features. Since mixture distributions are constrained in their L1 norm, typical sparsity techniques based on L1 regularization become toothless, and concave regularization becomes necessary. Unfortunately concave regularization typically results in EM algorithms that must perform problematic non-concave M-step maximizations. In this work, we introduce a technique for circumventing this difficulty, using the so-called Mountain Pass Theorem to provide easily verifiable conditions under which the M-step is well-behaved despite the lacking concavity. We also develop a correspondence between logarithmic regularization and what we term the pseudo-Dirichlet distribution, a generalization of the ordinary Dirichlet distribution well-suited for inducing sparsity. We demonstrate our approach on a text corpus, inferring a sparse topic mixture model for 2,406 weblogs."
1104,3790,2011,Hierarchical Topic Modeling for Analysis of Time-Evolving Personal Choices,"The nested Chinese restaurant process is extended to design a nonparametric  topic-model tree for representation of human choices. Each tree branch corresponds  to a type of person, and each node (topic) has a corresponding probability  vector over items that may be selected. The observed data are assumed to have  associated temporal covariates (corresponding to the time at which choices are  made), and we wish to impose that with increasing time it is more probable that  topics deeper in the tree are utilized. This structure is imposed by developing  a new ?change point"" stick-breaking model that is coupled with a Poisson and  product-of-gammas construction. To share topics across the tree nodes, topic distributions  are drawn from a Dirichlet process. As a demonstration of this concept,  we analyze real data on course selections of undergraduate students at Duke University,  with the goal of uncovering and concisely representing structure in the  curriculum and in the characteristics of the student body."
1105,3791,2011,Better Mini-Batch Algorithms via Accelerated Gradient Methods,"Mini-batch algorithms have recently received significant attention as a way to speed-up stochastic convex optimization problems. In this paper, we study how such algorithms can be improved using accelerated gradient methods. We provide a novel analysis, which shows how standard gradient methods may sometimes be insufficient to obtain a significant speed-up. We propose a novel accelerated gradient algorithm, which deals with this deficiency, and enjoys a uniformly superior guarantee. We conclude our paper with experiments  on real-world datasets, which validates our algorithm and  substantiates our theoretical insights."
1106,3792,2011,Co-Training for Domain Adaptation,"Domain adaptation algorithms seek to generalize a model trained in a source domain to a new target domain.  In many  practical cases, the source and target distributions can differ substantially, and in some cases crucial target features may not have support in the source domain.  In this paper we introduce an algorithm that bridges the gap between source and target domains by slowly adding both the target features and instances in which the current  algorithm is the most confident.  Our algorithm is a variant of co-training, and we name it CODA (Co-training for domain adaptation).  Unlike the original co-training work, we do not assume a particular feature split.  Instead, for each iteration of co-training, we add target features and formulate a single optimization problem which simultaneously learns a target predictor, a split of the feature space into views, and a shared subset of source  and target features to include in the predictor.  CODA significantly out-performs the state-of-the-art on the 12-domain benchmark data set of Blitzer et al.. Indeed, over a wide range (65 of 84 comparisons) of target supervision, ranging from no labeled target data to a relatively large number of target labels, CODA achieves the best performance."
1107,3793,2011,Linearized Alternating Direction Method with Adaptive Penalty for Low-Rank Representation,"Many machine learning and signal processing problems can be formulated as linearly constrained convex programs, which could be efficiently solved by the alternating direction method (ADM). However, usually the subproblems in ADM are easily solvable only when the linear mappings in the constraints are identities. To address this issue, we propose a linearized ADM (LADM) method by linearizing the quadratic penalty term and adding a proximal term when solving the subproblems. For fast convergence, we also allow the penalty to change adaptively according a novel update rule. We prove the global convergence of LADM with adaptive penalty (LADMAP). As an example, we apply LADMAP to solve low-rank representation (LRR), which is an important subspace clustering technique yet suffers from high computation cost. By combining LADMAP with a skinny SVD representation technique, we are able to reduce the complexity $O(n^3)$  of the original ADM based method to $O(rn^2)$, where $r$ and $n$ are the rank and size of the representation matrix, respectively, hence making LRR possible for large scale applications. Numerical experiments verify that for LRR our LADMAP based methods are much faster than state-of-the-art algorithms."
1108,3794,2011,Transfer from Multiple MDPs,"Transfer reinforcement learning (RL) methods leverage on the experience collected on a set of source tasks to speed-up RL algorithms. A simple and effective approach is to transfer samples from source tasks and include them in the training set used to solve a target task. In this paper, we investigate the theoretical properties of this transfer method and we introduce novel algorithms adapting the transfer process on the basis of the similarity between source and target tasks. Finally, we report illustrative experimental results in a continuous chain problem."
1109,3795,2011,Continuous-Time Regression Models for Longitudinal Networks,"The development of statistical models for continuous-time longitudinal network data is of increasing interest in machine learning and social science. Leveraging ideas from survival and event history analysis, we introduce a continuous-time regression modeling framework for network event data that can incorporate both time-dependent network statistics and time-varying regression coefficients. We also develop an efficient inference scheme that allows our approach to scale to large networks. On synthetic and real-world data, empirical results demonstrate that the proposed inference approach can accurately estimate the coefficients of the regression model, which is useful for interpreting the evolution of the network; furthermore, the learned model has systematically better predictive performance compared to standard baseline methods."
1110,3796,2011,A Reinforcement Learning Theory for Homeostatic Regulation,"Reinforcement learning models address animal's behavioral adaptation to its changing ""external"" environment, and are based on the assumption that Pavlovian, habitual and goal-directed responses seek to maximize reward acquisition. Negative-feedback models of homeostatic regulation, on the other hand, are concerned with behavioral adaptation in response to the ""internal"" state of the animal, and assume that animals' behavioral objective is to minimize deviations of some key physiological variables from their hypothetical setpoints. Building upon the drive-reduction theory of reward, we propose a new analytical framework that integrates learning and regulatory systems, such that the two seemingly unrelated objectives of reward maximization and physiological-stability prove to be identical. The proposed theory shows behavioral adaptation to both internal and external states in a disciplined way. We further show that the proposed framework allows for a unified explanation of some behavioral phenomenon like motivational sensitivity of different associative learning mechanism, anticipatory responses, interaction among competing motivational systems, and risk aversion."
1111,3797,2011,SpaRCS: Recovering low-rank and sparse matrices from compressive measurements,"We consider the problem of recovering a matrix $\mathbf{M}$ that is the sum of a low-rank matrix $\mathbf{L}$ and a sparse matrix $\mathbf{S}$ from a small set of linear measurements of the form $\mathbf{y} = \mathcal{A}(\mathbf{M}) = \mathcal{A}({\bf L}+{\bf S})$.  This model subsumes three important classes of signal recovery problems:  compressive sensing, affine rank minimization, and robust principal component analysis.  We propose a natural optimization problem for signal recovery under this model and develop a new greedy algorithm called SpaRCS to solve it.  SpaRCS inherits a number of desirable properties from the state-of-the-art CoSaMP and ADMiRA algorithms, including exponential convergence and efficient implementation.  Simulation results with video compressive sensing, hyperspectral imaging, and robust matrix completion data sets demonstrate both the accuracy and efficacy of the algorithm."
1112,3798,2011,Generalized Beta Mixtures of Gaussians,"In recent years, a rich variety of shrinkage priors have been proposed that have great promise in addressing massive regression problems.  In general, these new priors can be expressed as scale mixtures of normals, but have more complex forms and better properties than traditional Cauchy and double exponential priors. We first propose a new class of normal scale mixtures through a novel generalized beta distribution that encompasses many interesting priors as special cases.  This encompassing framework should prove useful in comparing competing priors, considering properties and revealing close connections. We then develop a class of variational Bayes approximations through the new hierarchy presented that will scale more efficiently to the types of truly massive data sets that are now encountered routinely."
1113,3800,2011,Identifying Alzheimer's Disease-Related Brain Regions from Multi-Modality Neuroimaging Data using Sparse Composite Linear Discrimination Analysis,"Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) at the early stage of the disease development is of great clinical importance. Current clinical assessment that relies primarily on cognitive measures proves low sensitivity and specificity. The fast growing neuroimaging techniques hold great promise. Research so far has focused on single neuroimaging modalities. However, as different modalities provide complementary measures for the same disease pathology, fusion of multi-modality data may increase the statistical power in identification of disease-related brain regions. This is especially true for early AD, at which stage the disease-related regions are most likely to be weak-effect regions that are difficult to be detected from a single modality alone. We propose a sparse composite linear discriminant analysis model (SCLDA) for identification of disease-related brain regions of early AD from multi-modality data. SCLDA uses a novel formulation that decomposes each LDA parameter into a product of a common parameter shared by all the modalities and a parameter specific to each modality, which enables joint analysis of all the modalities and borrowing strength from one another. We prove that this formulation is equivalent to a penalized likelihood with non-convex regularization, which can be solved by the DC ((difference of convex functions) programming. We show that in using the DC programming, the property of the non-convex regularization in terms of preserving weak-effect features can be nicely revealed. We perform extensive simulations to show that SCLDA outperforms existing competing algorithms on feature selection, especially on the ability for identifying weak-effect features. We apply SCLDA to the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images of 49 AD patients and 67 normal controls (NC). Our study identifies disease-related brain regions consistent with findings in the AD literature."
1114,3801,2011,Generalized Lasso based Approximation of Sparse Coding for Visual Recognition,"Sparse coding, a method of explaining sensory data with as few dictionary bases as possible, has attracted much attention in computer vision. For visual object category recognition, L1 regularized sparse coding is combined with spatial pyramid representation to obtain state-of-the-art performance. However, because of its iterative optimization, applying sparse coding onto every local feature descriptor extracted from an image database can become a major bottleneck. To overcome this computational challenge, this paper presents ""Generalized Lasso based Approximation of Sparse coding"" (GLAS). By representing the distribution of sparse coefficients with slice transform, we fit a piece-wise linear mapping function with generalized lasso. We also propose an efficient post-refinement procedure to perform mutual inhibition between bases which is essential for an overcomplete setting. The experiments show that GLAS obtains comparable performance to L1 regularized sparse coding, yet achieves significant speed up demonstrating its effectiveness for large-scale visual recognition problems."
1115,3802,2011,A rational model of causal inference with continuous causes,"Rational models of causal induction have been successful in accounting for people's judgments about the existence of causal relationships. However, these models have focused on explaining inferences from discrete data of the kind that can be summarized in a 2 ? 2 contingency table. This severely limits the scope of these models, since the world often provides non-binary data. We develop a new rational model of causal induction using continuous dimensions, which aims to diminish the gap between empirical and theoretical approaches and real-world causal induction. This model successfully predicts human judgments from previous studies better than models of discrete causal inference, and outperforms several other plausible models of causal induction with continuous causes in accounting for people's inferences in a new experiment."
1116,3803,2011,Algorithms for Hyper-Parameter Optimization,"Several recent advances to the state of the art in image classification benchmarks have come from better configurations of existing techniques rather than novel approaches to feature learning. Traditionally, hyper-parameter optimization has been the job of humans because they can be very efficient in regimes where only a few trials are possible. Presently, computer clusters and GPU processors make it possible to run more trials and we show that algorithmic approaches can find better results. We present hyper-parameter optimization results on tasks of training neural networks and deep belief networks (DBNs). We optimize hyper-parameters using random search and two new greedy sequential methods based on the expected improvement criterion. Random search has been shown to be sufficiently efficient for learning neural networks for several datasets, but we show it is unreliable for training DBNs. The sequential algorithms are applied to the most difficult DBN learning problems from [Larochelle et al., 2007] and find significantly better results than the best previously reported. This work contributes novel techniques for making response surface models P (y|x) in which many elements of hyper-parameter assignment (x) are known to be irrelevant given particular values of other elements."
1117,3804,2011,Algorithms and hardness results for parallel large margin learning,"We study the fundamental problem of learning an unknown large-margin halfspace in the context of parallel computation.    Our main positive result is a parallel algorithm for learning a large-margin halfspace that is based on interior point methods from convex optimization and fast parallel algorithms for matrix computations. We show that this algorithm learns an unknown gamma-margin halfspace over n dimensions using poly(n,1/gamma) processors and runs in time ~O(1/gamma) + O(log n). In contrast, naive parallel algorithms that learn a gamma-margin halfspace in time that depends polylogarithmically on n have Omega(1/gamma^2) runtime dependence on gamma.     Our main negative result deals with boosting, which is a standard approach to learning large-margin halfspaces. We give an information-theoretic proof that in the original PAC framework, in which a weak learning algorithm is provided as an oracle that is called by the booster, boosting cannot be parallelized: the ability to  call the weak learner multiple times in parallel within a single boosting stage does not reduce the overall number of successive stages of boosting that are required."
1118,3805,2011,Linear Submodular Bandits and their Application to Diversified Retrieval,"Diversified retrieval and online learning are two core research areas in the design of modern information retrieval systems.In this paper, we propose the linear submodular bandits problem, which is an online learning setting for optimizing a general class of feature-rich submodular utility models for diversified retrieval. We present an algorithm, called LSBGREEDY, and prove that it efficiently converges to a near-optimal model. As a case study, we applied our approach to the setting of personalized news recommendation, where the system must recommend small sets of news articles selected from tens of thousands of available articles each day. In a live user study, we found that LSBGREEDY significantly outperforms existing online learning approaches."
1119,3806,2011,Efficient Online Learning via Randomized Rounding,"Most online algorithms used in machine learning today are based on variants of mirror descent or follow-the-leader. In this paper, we present an online algorithm based on a completely different approach, which combines ``random playout'' and randomized rounding of loss subgradients. As an application of our approach, we provide the first computationally efficient online algorithm for collaborative filtering with trace-norm constrained matrices. As a second application, we solve an open question linking batch learning and transductive online learning."
1120,3807,2011,Exploiting spatial overlap to efficiently compute appearance distances between image windows,"We present a computationally efficient technique to compute the distance of high-dimensional appearance descriptor vectors between image windows.  The method exploits the relation between appearance distance and spatial overlap.  We derive an upper bound on appearance distance given the spatial overlap of two windows in an image,  and use it to bound the distances of many pairs between two images.  We propose algorithms that build on these basic operations to efficiently solve tasks relevant to many computer vision applications, such as finding all pairs of windows between two images with distance smaller than a threshold,  or finding the single pair with the smallest distance. In experiments on the PASCAL VOC 07 dataset, our algorithms accurately solve these problems while greatly reducing the number of appearance distances computed, and achieve larger speedups than approximate nearest neighbour algorithms based on trees [18]and on hashing [21].    For example, our algorithm finds the most similar pair of windows between two images while computing only 1% of all distances on average."
1121,3808,2011,Accelerated Adaptive Markov Chain for Partition Function Computation,"We propose a novel Adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to  compute the partition function. In particular, we show how to  accelerate a flat histogram sampling technique by significantly  reducing the number of ``null moves'' in the chain, while maintaining  asymptotic convergence properties. Our experiments show that our  method converges quickly to highly accurate solutions on a range of  benchmark instances, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods such  as IJGP, TRW, and Gibbs sampling both in run-time and accuracy. We  also show how obtaining a so-called density of states distribution  allows for efficient weight learning in Markov Logic theories."
1122,3809,2011,Policy Gradient Coagent Networks,"We present a novel class of actor-critic algorithms for actors consisting of sets of interacting modules. We present, analyze theoretically, and empirically evaluate an update rule for each module, which requires only local information: the module's input, output, and the TD error broadcast by a critic. Such updates are necessary when computation of compatible features becomes prohibitively difficult and are also desirable to increase the biological plausibility of reinforcement learning methods."
1123,3811,2011,Multiclass Boosting: Theory and Algorithms,"The problem of  multiclass boosting is considered. A new framework,based on multi-dimensional codewords and predictors is introduced. The optimal set of codewords is derived, and a margin enforcing loss proposed. The resulting risk is minimized by gradient descent on a multidimensional functional space. Two algorithms are proposed: 1) CD-MCBoost, based on coordinate descent, updates one predictor component at a time, 2) GD-MCBoost, based on gradient descent, updates all components jointly. The algorithms differ in the weak learners that they support but are both shown to be 1) Bayes consistent, 2) margin enforcing, and 3) convergent to the global minimum of the risk. They also reduce to AdaBoost when there are only two classes. Experiments show that both methods outperform previous multiclass boosting approaches on a number of datasets."
1124,3812,2011,Understanding the Intrinsic Memorability of Images,"Artists, advertisers, and photographers are routinely presented with the task of creating an image that a viewer will remember. While it may seem like image memorability is purely subjective, recent work shows that it is not an inexplicable phenomenon: variation in memorability of images is consistent across subjects, suggesting that some images are intrinsically more memorable than others, independent of a subjects' contexts and biases. In this paper, we used the publicly available memorability dataset of Isola et al., and augmented the object and scene annotations with interpretable spatial, content, and aesthetic image properties. We used a feature-selection scheme with desirable explaining-away properties to determine a compact set of attributes that characterizes the memorability of any individual image. We find that images of enclosed spaces containing people with visible faces are memorable, while images of vistas and peaceful scenes are not. Contrary to popular belief, unusual or aesthetically pleasing scenes do not tend to be highly memorable. This work represents one of the first attempts at understanding intrinsic image memorability, and opens a new domain of investigation at the interface between human cognition and computer vision."
1125,3813,2011,Convergence Rates of Inexact Proximal-Gradient Methods for Convex Optimization,"We consider the problem of optimizing the sum of a smooth convex function and a non-smooth convex function using proximal-gradient methods, where an error is present in the calculation of the gradient of the smooth term or in the proximity operator with respect to the second term. We show that the basic proximal-gradient method, the basic proximal-gradient method with a strong convexity assumption, and the accelerated proximal-gradient method achieve the same convergence rates as in the error-free case, provided the errors decrease at an appropriate rate.  Our experimental results on a structured sparsity problem indicate that sequences of errors with these appealing theoretical properties can lead to practical performance improvements."
1126,3814,2011,Statistical Performance of Convex Tensor Decomposition,"We analyze the statistical performance of a recently proposed convex tensor decomposition algorithm. Conventionally tensor decomposition has been formulated as non-convex optimization problems, which hindered the analysis of their performance. We show under some conditions that the mean squared error of the convex method scales linearly with the quantity we call the normalized rank of the true tensor. The current analysis naturally extends the analysis of convex low-rank matrix estimation to tensors. Furthermore, we show through numerical experiments that our theory can precisely predict the scaling behaviour in practice."
1127,3815,2011,High-dimensional regression with noisy and missing data: Provable guarantees with non-convexity,"Although the standard formulations of prediction problems involve fully-observed and noiseless data drawn in an i.i.d. manner, many  applications involve noisy and/or missing data, possibly involving dependencies. We study these issues in the context of high-dimensional  sparse linear regression, and propose novel estimators for the cases of noisy, missing, and/or dependent data. Many standard approaches to noisy or missing data, such as those using the EM algorithm, lead to optimization problems that are inherently non-convex, and it is difficult to establish theoretical guarantees on practical algorithms. While our approach also involves optimizing non-convex programs, we are able to both analyze the statistical error associated with any global optimum, and prove that a simple projected gradient descent algorithm will converge in polynomial time to a small neighborhood of the set of global minimizers. On the statistical side, we provide non-asymptotic bounds that hold with high probability for the cases of noisy, missing, and/or dependent data. On the computational side, we prove that under the same types of conditions required for statistical consistency, the projected gradient descent algorithm will converge at geometric rates to a near-global minimizer. We illustrate these theoretical predictions with simulations, showing agreement with the predicted scalings."
1128,3816,2011,k-NN Regression Adapts to Local Intrinsic Dimension,"Many nonparametric regressors were recently shown to converge at rates that depend only on the intrinsic dimension of data.  These regressors thus escape the curse of dimension when high-dimensional data has low intrinsic dimension (e.g. a manifold).   We show that $k$-NN regression is also adaptive to intrinsic dimension. In particular our rates are local to a query $x$   and depend only on the way masses of balls centered at $x$ vary with radius.    Furthermore, we show a simple way to choose $k = k(x)$ locally at any $x$ so as to nearly achieve the minimax rate at $x$  in terms of the unknown intrinsic dimension in the vicinity of $x$. We also establish that the minimax rate does not depend   on a particular choice of metric space or distribution, but rather that this minimax rate holds for any metric space and doubling measure."
1129,3817,2011,Unifying Non-Maximum Likelihood Learning Objectives with Minimum KL Contraction,"When used to learn high dimensional parametric probabilistic models, the clas- sical maximum likelihood (ML) learning often suffers from computational in- tractability, which motivates the active developments of non-ML learning meth- ods. Yet, because of their divergent motivations and forms, the objective func- tions of many non-ML learning methods are seemingly unrelated, and there lacks a unified framework to understand them. In this work, based on an information geometric view of parametric learning, we introduce a general non-ML learning principle termed as minimum KL contraction, where we seek optimal parameters that minimizes the contraction of the KL divergence between the two distributions after they are transformed with a KL contraction operator. We then show that the objective functions of several important or recently developed non-ML learn- ing methods, including contrastive divergence [12], noise-contrastive estimation [11], partial likelihood [7], non-local contrastive objectives [31], score match- ing [14], pseudo-likelihood [3], maximum conditional likelihood [17], maximum mutual information [2], maximum marginal likelihood [9], and conditional and marginal composite likelihood [24], can be unified under the minimum KL con- traction framework with different choices of the KL contraction operators."
1130,3818,2011,Shaping Level Sets with Submodular Functions,"We consider a class of sparsity-inducing regularization terms based on submodular functions. While previous work has focused on  non-decreasing functions, we explore symmetric submodular functions and their \lova extensions. We show that the Lovasz extension may be seen as the convex envelope of a function that depends on level sets  (i.e., the set of indices whose corresponding components of the underlying predictor are greater than a given constant): this leads to a class of convex structured regularization terms that impose prior knowledge on the level sets, and not only on the supports of the underlying predictors. We provide a unified set of optimization algorithms, such as proximal operators, and theoretical guarantees (allowed level sets and recovery conditions). By selecting specific submodular functions,  we   give a new interpretation to known norms, such as the total variation; we also define new norms, in particular ones that are based on order statistics with application to clustering and outlier detection, and on noisy cuts in graphs with application to change point detection in the presence of outliers."
1131,3819,2011,Simultaneous Sampling and Multi-Structure Fitting with Adaptive Reversible Jump MCMC,"Multi-structure model fitting has traditionally taken a two-stage approach: First, sample a (large) number of model hypotheses, then select the subset of hypotheses that optimise a joint fitting and model selection criterion. This disjoint two-stage approach is arguably suboptimal and inefficient - if the random sampling did not retrieve a good set of hypotheses, the optimised outcome will not represent a good fit. To overcome this weakness we propose a new multi-structure fitting approach based on Reversible Jump MCMC. Instrumental in raising the effectiveness of our method is an adaptive hypothesis generator, whose proposal distribution is learned incrementally and online. We prove that this adaptive proposal satisfies the diminishing adaptation property crucial for ensuring ergodicity in MCMC. Our method effectively conducts hypothesis sampling and optimisation simultaneously, and gives superior computational efficiency over other methods."
1132,3820,2011,Projection onto A Nonnegative Max-Heap,"We consider the problem of computing the Euclidean projection of a vector of length $p$ onto a non-negative max-heap---an ordered tree where the values of the nodes are all nonnegative and the value of any parent node is no less than the value(s) of its child node(s). This Euclidean projection plays a building block role in the optimization problem with a non-negative max-heap constraint. Such a constraint is desirable when the features follow an ordered tree structure, that is, a given feature is selected for the given regression/classification task only if its parent node is selected. In this paper, we show that such Euclidean projection problem admits an analytical solution and we develop a top-down algorithm where the key operation is to find the so-called \emph{maximal root-tree} of the subtree rooted at each node. A naive approach for finding the maximal root-tree is to enumerate all the possible root-trees, which, however, does not scale well. We reveal several important properties of the maximal root-tree, based on which we design a bottom-up algorithm with merge for efficiently finding the maximal root-tree. The proposed algorithm has a (worst-case) linear time complexity for a sequential list, and $O(p^2)$ for a general tree. We report simulation results showing the effectiveness of the max-heap for regression with an ordered tree structure. Empirical results show that the proposed algorithm has an expected linear time complexity for many special cases including a sequential list, a full binary tree, and a tree with depth 1."
1133,3822,2011,Maximal Cliques that Satisfy Hard Constraints with Application to Deformable Object Model Learning,"We propose a novel inference framework for finding maximal cliques in a weighted graph that satisfy hard constraints.  The constraints specify the graph nodes that must belong to the solution as well as mutual exclusions of graph nodes, i.e., sets of nodes that cannot belong to the same solution.  The proposed inference is based on a novel particle filter algorithm with state permeations. We apply the inference framework to a challenging problem of learning part-based, deformable object models. Two core problems in the learning framework, matching of image patches and finding salient parts, are formulated as two instances of the problem of finding maximal cliques with hard constraints. Our learning framework yields discriminative part based object models that achieve very good detection rate, and outperform other methods on object classes with large deformation."
1134,3824,2011,Orthogonal Matching Pursuit with Replacement,"In this paper, we consider the problem of compressed sensing where the goal is to recover almost all the sparse vectors using a small number of fixed linear measurements. For this problem, we propose a novel partial hard-thresholding operator leading to a general family of iterative algorithms. While one extreme of the family yields well known hard thresholding algorithms like ITI and HTP, the other end of the spectrum leads to a novel algorithm that we call  Orthogonal Matching Pursuit with Replacement (OMPR). OMPR, like the classic greedy algorithm OMP, adds exactly one coordinate to the support at each iteration, based on the correlation with the current residual. However, unlike OMP, OMPR also removes one coordinate from the support. This simple change allows us to prove the best known guarantees for OMPR in terms of the Restricted Isometry Property (a condition on the measurement matrix). In contrast, OMP is known to have very weak performance guarantees under RIP.  We also extend OMPR using locality sensitive hashing to get OMPR-Hash, the first provably sub-linear (in dimensionality) algorithm for sparse recovery. Our  proof techniques are novel and flexible enough to also permit the tightest known analysis of popular iterative algorithms such as CoSaMP and Subspace Pursuit.  We provide experimental results on large problems providing  recovery for vectors of size up to million dimensions.  We demonstrate that for large-scale problems our proposed methods are more robust and faster than the existing  methods."
1135,3826,2011,Quasi-Newton Methods for Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"The performance of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is often sensitive to the scaling and correlations between the random variables of interest. An important source of information about the local correlation and scale is given by the Hessian matrix of the target distribution, but this is often either computationally expensive or infeasible. In this paper we propose MCMC samplers that make use of quasi-Newton approximations from the optimization literature, that approximate the Hessian of the target distribution from previous samples and gradients generated by the sampler. A key issue is that MCMC samplers that depend on the history of previous states are in general not valid. We address this problem by using limited memory quasi-Newton methods, which depend only on a fixed window of previous samples. On several real world datasets, we show that the quasi-Newton sampler is a more effective sampler than standard Hamiltonian Monte Carlo at a fraction of the cost of MCMC methods that require higher-order derivatives."
1136,3827,2011,"Online Submodular Set Cover, Ranking, and Repeated Active Learning","We propose an online prediction version of submodular set cover with connections to ranking and repeated active learning.  In each round, the learning algorithm chooses a sequence of items.  The algorithm then receives a monotone submodular function and suffers loss equal to the cover time of the function: the number of items needed, when items are selected in order of the chosen sequence, to achieve a coverage constraint.  We develop an online learning algorithm whose loss converges to approximately that of the best sequence in hindsight.  Our proposed algorithm is readily extended to a setting where multiple functions are revealed at each round and to bandit and contextual bandit settings."
1137,3828,2011,How Do Humans Teach: On Curriculum Learning and Teaching Dimension,"We study the empirical strategies that humans follow as they teach a target concept with a simple 1D threshold to a robot.  Previous studies of computational teaching, particularly the teaching dimension model and the curriculum learning principle, offer contradictory predictions on what optimal strategy the teacher should follow in this teaching task. We show through behavioral studies that humans employ three distinct teaching strategies, one of which is consistent with the curriculum learning principle, and propose a novel theoretical framework as a potential explanation for this strategy. This framework, which assumes a teaching goal of minimizing the learner's expected generalization error at each iteration, extends the standard teaching dimension model and offers a theoretical justification for curriculum learning."
1138,3829,2011,ICA with Reconstruction Cost for Efficient Overcomplete Feature Learning,"Independent Components Analysis (ICA) and its variants have been successfully used for unsupervised feature learning. However, standard ICA requires an orthonoramlity constraint to be enforced, which makes it dif?cult to learn overcomplete features. In addition, ICA is sensitive to whitening. These properties make it challenging to scale ICA to high dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a robust soft reconstruction cost for ICA that allows us to learn highly overcomplete sparse features even on unwhitened data. Our formulation reveals formal connections between ICA and sparse autoencoders, which have previously been observed only empirically. Our algorithm can be used in conjunction with off-the-shelf fast unconstrained optimizers. We show that the soft reconstruction cost can also be used to prevent replicated features in tiled convolutional neural networks. Using our method to learn highly overcomplete sparse features and tiled convolutional neural networks, we obtain competitive performances on a wide variety of object recognition tasks. We achieve state-of-the-art test accuracies on the STL-10 and Hollywood2 datasets."
1139,3830,2011,Inferring spike-timing-dependent plasticity from spike train data,"Synaptic plasticity underlies learning and is thus central for development, memory, and recovery from injury. However, it is often difficult to detect changes in synaptic strength in vivo, since intracellular recordings are experimentally challenging. Here we present two methods aimed at inferring changes in the coupling between pairs of neurons from extracellularly recorded spike trains. First, using a generalized bilinear model with Poisson output we estimate time-varying coupling assuming that all changes are spike-timing-dependent. This approach allows model-based estimation of STDP modification functions from pairs of spike trains. Then, using recursive point-process adaptive filtering methods we estimate more general variation in coupling strength over time. Using simulations of neurons undergoing spike-timing dependent modification, we show that the true modification function can be recovered. Using multi-electrode data from motor cortex we then illustrate the use of this technique on in vivo data."
1140,3831,2011,Ranking annotators for crowdsourced labeling tasks,"With the advent of crowdsourcing services it has become quite cheap and reasonably effective to get a dataset labeled by multiple annotators in a short amount of time. Various methods have been proposed to estimate the consensus labels by correcting for the bias of annotators with different kinds of expertise. Often we have low quality annotators or spammers--annotators who assign labels randomly (e.g., without actually looking at the instance). Spammers can make the cost of acquiring labels very expensive and can potentially degrade the quality of the consensus labels. In this paper we formalize the notion of a spammer and define a score which can be used to rank the annotators---with the spammers having a score close to zero and the good annotators having a high score close to one."
1141,3833,2011,Im2Text: Describing Images Using 1 Million Captioned Photographs,"We develop and demonstrate automatic image description methods using a large captioned photo collection.  One contribution is our technique for the automatic collection of this new dataset -- performing a huge number of Flickr queries and then filtering the noisy results down to 1 million images with associated visually relevant captions.  Such a collection allows us to approach the extremely challenging problem of description generation using relatively simple non-parametric methods and produces surprisingly effective results. We also develop methods incorporating many state of the art, but fairly noisy, estimates of image content to produce even more pleasing results. Finally we introduce a new objective performance measure for image captioning."
1142,3834,2011,Analytical Results for the Error in Filtering of Gaussian Processes,"Bayesian filtering of stochastic stimuli has received a great deal of attention re- cently. It has been applied to describe the way in which biological systems dy- namically represent and make decisions about the environment. There have been no exact results for the error in the biologically plausible setting of inference on point process, however. We present an exact analysis of the evolution of the mean- squared error in a state estimation task using Gaussian-tuned point processes as sensors. This allows us to study the dynamics of the error of an optimal Bayesian decoder, providing insights into the limits obtainable in this task. This is done for Markovian and a class of non-Markovian Gaussian processes. We find that there is an optimal tuning width for which the error is minimized. This leads to a char- acterization of the optimal encoding for the setting as a function of the statistics of the stimulus, providing a mathematically sound primer for an ecological theory of sensory processing."
1143,3835,2011,TD_gamma: Re-evaluating Complex Backups in Temporal Difference Learning,"We show that the lambda-return target used in the TD(lambda) family of algorithms is the maximum likelihood estimator for a specific model of how the variance of an n-step return estimate increases with n. We introduce the gamma-return estimator, an alternative target based on a more accurate model of variance, which defines the TD_gamma family of complex-backup temporal difference learning algorithms. We derive TD_gamma, the gamma-return equivalent of the original TD(lambda) algorithm, which eliminates the lambda parameter but can only perform updates at the end of an episode and requires time and space proportional to the episode length. We then derive a second algorithm, TD_gamma(C), with a capacity parameter C. TD_gamma(C) requires C times more time and memory than TD(lambda) and is incremental and online. We show that TD_gamma outperforms TD(lambda) for any setting of lambda on 4 out of 5 benchmark domains, and that TD_gamma(C) performs as well as or better than TD_gamma for intermediate settings of C."
1144,3837,2011,Learning to Learn with Compound HD Models,"We introduce HD (or ``Hierarchical-Deep'') models, a new compositional learning architecture that integrates deep learning models with structured hierarchical Bayesian models. Specifically we show how we can learn a hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) prior over the activities of the top-level features in a Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM).  This compound HDP-DBM model learns to learn novel concepts from very few training examples, by learning low-level generic features, high-level features that capture correlations among low-level features, and a category hierarchy for sharing priors over the high-level features that are typical of different kinds of concepts.  We present efficient learning and inference algorithms for the HDP-DBM model and show that it is able to learn new concepts from very few examples on CIFAR-100 object recognition, handwritten character recognition, and human motion capture datasets."
1145,3838,2011,Stochastic convex optimization with bandit feedback,"This paper addresses the problem of minimizing a convex, Lipschitz  function $f$ over a convex, compact set $X$ under a stochastic bandit feedback model. In this model, the algorithm is allowed to  observe noisy realizations of the function value $f(x)$ at any query  point $x \in X$. We demonstrate a generalization of the  ellipsoid algorithm that incurs $O(\poly(d)\sqrt{T})$ regret. Since any algorithm has regret at least $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$  on this problem, our algorithm is optimal in terms of the scaling  with $T$."
1146,3839,2011,See the Tree Through the Lines: The Shazoo Algorithm,"Predicting the nodes of a given graph is a fascinating   theoretical problem with applications in several domains.   Since graph sparsification via spanning trees   retains enough information while making the task much easier,   trees are an important special case of this problem.   Although it is known how to predict the nodes of an unweighted tree   in a nearly optimal way, in the weighted case a fully satisfactory   algorithm is not available yet. We fill this hole and introduce an efficient node predictor,   Shazoo, which is nearly optimal on any weighted tree. Moreover, we show that Shazoo can   be viewed as a common nontrivial generalization of both previous approaches for   unweighted trees and weighted lines.   Experiments on real-world datasets confirm that Shazoo performs well in that   it fully exploits the structure of the input tree,   and gets very close to (and sometimes better than)   less scalable energy minimization methods."
1147,3840,2011,Monte Carlo Value Iteration with Macro-Actions,"POMDP planning faces two major computational challenges: large state spaces and long planning horizons. The recently introduced Monte Carlo Value Iteration (MCVI) can tackle POMDPs with very large discrete state spaces or continuous state spaces, but its performance degrades when faced with long planning horizons. This paper presents Macro-MCVI, which extends MCVI by exploiting macro-actions for temporal abstraction. We provide sufficient conditions for Macro-MCVI to inherit the good theoretical properties of MCVI. Macro-MCVI does not require explicit construction of probabilistic models for macro-actions and is thus easy to apply in practice. Experiments show that Macro-MCVI substantially improves the performance of MCVI with suitable macro-actions."
1148,3841,2011,Multi-Bandit Best Arm Identification,"We study the problem of identifying the best arm in each of the bandits in a multi-bandit multi-armed setting. We first propose an algorithm called Gap-based Exploration (GapE) that focuses on the arms whose mean is close to the mean of the best arm in the same bandit (i.e., small gap). We then introduce an algorithm, called GapE-V, which takes into account the variance of the arms in addition to their gap. We prove an upper-bound on the probability of error for both algorithms. Since GapE and GapE-V need to tune an exploration parameter that depends on the complexity of the problem, which is often unknown in advance, we also introduce variations of these algorithms that estimate this complexity online. Finally, we evaluate the performance of these algorithms and compare them to other allocation strategies on a number of synthetic problems."
1149,3842,2011,MAP Inference for Bayesian Inverse Reinforcement Learning,"The difficulty in inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) arises in choosing the best reward function since there are typically an infinite number of reward functions that yield the given behaviour data as optimal. Using a Bayesian framework, we address this challenge by using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation for the reward function, and show that most of the previous IRL algorithms can be modeled into our framework. We also present a gradient method for the MAP estimation based on the (sub)differentiability of the posterior distribution. We show the effectiveness of our approach by comparing the performance of the proposed method to those of the previous algorithms."
1150,3844,2011,Generalised Coupled Tensor Factorisation,"We derive algorithms for generalised tensor factorisation (GTF) by building upon the well-established theory of Generalised Linear Models. Our algorithms are general in the sense that we can compute arbitrary factorisations in a message passing framework, derived for a broad class of exponential family distributions including special cases such as Tweedie's distributions corresponding to $\beta$-divergences. By bounding the step size of the Fisher Scoring iteration of the GLM, we obtain general updates for real data and multiplicative updates for non-negative data. The GTF framework is, then extended easily to address the problems when multiple observed tensors are factorised simultaneously. We illustrate our coupled factorisation approach on synthetic data as well as on a musical audio restoration problem."
1151,3845,2011,Portmanteau Vocabularies for Multi-Cue Image Representation,"We describe a novel technique for feature combination in the bag-of-words model of image classification. Our approach builds discriminative compound words from primitive cues learned independently from training images. Our main observation is that modeling joint-cue distributions independently is more statistically robust for typical classification problems than attempting to empirically estimate the dependent, joint-cue distribution directly. We use Information theoretic vocabulary compression to find discriminative combinations of cues and the resulting vocabulary of portmanteau words is compact, has the cue binding property, and supports individual weighting of cues in the final image representation. State-of-the-art results on both the Oxford Flower-102 and Caltech-UCSD Bird-200 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique compared to other, significantly more complex approaches to multi-cue image representation"
1152,3846,2011,Learning Auto-regressive Models from Sequence and Non-sequence Data,"Vector Auto-regressive models (VAR) are useful tools for analyzing time series  data. In quite a few modern time series modelling tasks, the collection of reliable  time series turns out to be a major challenge, either due to the slow progression of  the dynamic process of interest, or inaccessibility of repetitive measurements of  the same dynamic process over time. In those situations, however, we observe that  it is often easier to collect a large amount of non-sequence samples, or snapshots  of the dynamic process of interest. In this work, we assume a small amount of time  series data are available, and propose methods to incorporate non-sequence data  into penalized least-square estimation of VAR models. We consider non-sequence  data as samples drawn from the stationary distribution of the underlying VAR  model, and devise a novel penalization scheme based on the discrete-time Lyapunov  equation concerning the covariance of the stationary distribution. Experiments  on synthetic and video data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed  methods."
1153,3847,2011,Multiple Instance Learning on Structured Data,"Most existing Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) algorithms  assume data instances and/or data bags are independently and  identically distributed. But there often exists rich additional  dependency/structure information between instances/bags within many  applications of MIL. Ignoring this structure information limits the  performance of existing MIL algorithms. This paper explores the  research problem as multiple instance learning on structured  data (MILSD) and formulates a novel framework that considers  additional structure information. In particular, an effective and  efficient optimization algorithm has been proposed to solve the  original non-convex optimization problem by using a combination of  Concave-Convex Constraint Programming (CCCP) method and an adapted  Cutting Plane method, which deals with two sets of constraints caused  by learning on  instances within individual bags and learning on  structured data. Our method has the nice convergence property,  with specified precision on each set of constraints. Experimental  results on three different applications, i.e., webpage  classification, market targeting, and protein fold identification,  clearly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over  state-of-the-art methods."
1154,3848,2011,Structured Learning for Cell Tracking,We study the problem of learning to track a large quantity of homogeneous objects such as cell tracking in cell culture study and developmental biology. Reliable cell tracking in time-lapse microscopic image sequences is important for modern biomedical research. Existing cell tracking methods are usually kept simple and use only a small number of features to allow for manual parameter tweaking or grid search. We propose a structured learning approach that allows to learn optimum parameters automatically from a training set. This allows for the use of a richer set of features which in turn affords improved tracking compared to recently reported methods on two public benchmark sequences.
1155,3849,2011,Action-Gap Phenomenon in Reinforcement Learning,"Many practitioners of reinforcement learning problems have observed that oftentimes  the performance of the agent reaches very close to the optimal performance even though the estimated (action-)value function is still far from the optimal one.  The goal of this paper is to explain and formalize this phenomenon by introducing the concept of the action-gap regularity.  As a typical result, we prove that for an agent following the greedy policy \(\hat{\pi}\) with respect to an action-value function \(\hat{Q}\), the performance loss \(E[V^*(X) - V^{\hat{X}} (X)]\) is upper bounded by \(O(|| \hat{Q} - Q^*||_\infty^{1+\zeta}\)), in which \(\zeta >= 0\) is the parameter quantifying the action-gap regularity.  For \(\zeta > 0\), our results indicate smaller performance loss compared to what previous analyses had suggested.  Finally, we show how this regularity affects the performance of the family of approximate value iteration algorithms."
1156,3850,2011,Divide-and-Conquer Matrix Factorization,"This work introduces Divide-Factor-Combine (DFC), a parallel divide-and-conquer framework for noisy matrix factorization.  DFC divides a large-scale matrix factorization task into smaller subproblems, solves each subproblem in parallel using an arbitrary base matrix factorization algorithm, and combines the subproblem solutions using techniques from randomized matrix approximation.  Our experiments with collaborative filtering, video background modeling, and simulated data demonstrate the near-linear to super-linear speed-ups attainable with this approach.  Moreover, our analysis shows that DFC enjoys high-probability recovery guarantees comparable to those of its base algorithm."
1157,3851,2011,Contextual Gaussian Process Bandit Optimization,"How should we design experiments to maximize performance of a complex system, taking into account uncontrollable environmental conditions? How should we select relevant documents (ads) to display, given information about the user? These tasks can be formalized as contextual bandit problems, where at each round, we receive context (about the experimental conditions, the query), and have to choose an action (parameters, documents). The key challenge is to trade off exploration by gathering data for estimating the mean payoff function over the context-action space, and to exploit by choosing an action deemed optimal based on the gathered data. We model the payoff function as a sample from a Gaussian process defined over the joint context-action space, and develop CGP-UCB, an intuitive upper-confidence style algorithm. We show that by mixing and matching kernels for contexts and actions, CGP-UCB can handle a variety of practical applications. We further provide generic tools for deriving regret bounds when using such composite kernel functions. Lastly, we evaluate our algorithm on two case studies, in the context of automated vaccine design and sensor management. We show that context-sensitive optimization outperforms no or naive use of context."
1158,3852,2012,Gradient-based kernel method for feature extraction and variable selection,"We propose a novel kernel approach to dimension reduction for supervised learning: feature extraction and variable selection; the former constructs a small number of features from predictors, and the latter finds a subset of predictors. First, a method of linear feature extraction is proposed using the gradient of regression function, based on the recent development of the kernel method.  In comparison with other existing methods, the proposed one has wide applicability without strong assumptions on the regressor or type of variables, and uses computationally simple eigendecomposition, thus applicable to large data sets.  Second, in combination of a sparse penalty, the method is extended to variable selection, following the approach by Chen et al. (2010).  Experimental results show that the proposed methods successfully find effective features and variables without parametric models."
1159,3855,2012,Learning from the Wisdom of Crowds by Minimax Entropy,"An important way to make large training sets is to gather noisy labels from crowds of nonexperts. We propose a minimax entropy principle to improve the quality of these labels. Our method assumes that labels are generated by a probability distribution over workers, items, and labels. By maximizing the entropy of this distribution, the method naturally infers item confusability and worker expertise. We infer the ground truth by minimizing the entropy of this distribution, which we show minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the probability distribution and the unknown truth. We show that a simple coordinate descent scheme can optimize minimax entropy. Empirically, our results are substantially better than previously published methods for the same problem."
1160,3856,2012,Efficient Sampling for Bipartite Matching Problems,"Bipartite matching problems characterize many situations, ranging from ranking in information retrieval to correspondence in vision. Exact inference in real-world applications of these problems is intractable, making efficient approximation methods essential for learning and inference. In this paper we propose a novel {\it sequential matching} sampler based on the generalization of the Plackett-Luce model, which can effectively make large moves in the space of matchings. This allows the sampler to match the difficult target distributions common in these problems: highly multimodal distributions with well separated modes. We present experimental results with bipartite matching problems - ranking and image correspondence - which show that the sequential matching sampler efficiently approximates the target distribution, significantly outperforming other sampling approaches."
1161,3857,2012,Learning Halfspaces with the Zero-One Loss: Time-Accuracy Tradeoffs,"Given $\alpha,\epsilon$, we study the time complexity   required to improperly learn a halfspace with misclassification   error rate of at most $(1+\alpha)\,L^*_\gamma + \epsilon$, where   $L^*_\gamma$ is the optimal $\gamma$-margin error rate. For $\alpha   = 1/\gamma$, polynomial time and sample complexity is achievable   using the hinge-loss. For $\alpha = 0$, \cite{ShalevShSr11} showed   that $\poly(1/\gamma)$ time is impossible, while learning is   possible in time $\exp(\tilde{O}(1/\gamma))$.  An immediate   question, which this paper tackles, is what is achievable if $\alpha   \in (0,1/\gamma)$.  We derive positive results interpolating between   the polynomial time for $\alpha = 1/\gamma$ and the exponential   time for $\alpha=0$. In particular, we show that there are cases in   which $\alpha = o(1/\gamma)$ but the problem is still solvable in   polynomial time. Our results naturally extend to the adversarial   online learning model and to the PAC learning with malicious noise   model."
1162,3858,2012,FastEx: Hash Clustering with Exponential Families,"Clustering is a key component in data analysis toolbox. Despite its   importance, scalable algorithms often eschew rich statistical models   in favor of simpler descriptions such as $k$-means clustering. In   this paper we present a sampler, capable of estimating   mixtures of exponential families. At its heart lies a novel proposal distribution using random   projections to achieve high throughput in generating proposals, which is crucial   for clustering models with large numbers of clusters."
1163,3859,2012,Bayesian Warped Gaussian Processes,"Warped Gaussian processes (WGP) [1] model output observations in regression tasks as a parametric nonlinear transformation of a Gaussian process (GP). The use of this nonlinear transformation, which is included as part of the probabilistic model, was shown to enhance performance by providing a better prior model on several data sets. In order to learn its parameters, maximum likelihood was used. In this work we show that it is possible to use a non-parametric nonlinear transformation in WGP and variationally integrate it out. The resulting Bayesian WGP is then able to work in scenarios in which the maximum likelihood WGP failed: Low data regime, data with censored values, classification, etc. We demonstrate the superior performance of Bayesian warped GPs on several real data sets."
1164,3860,2012,Active Comparison of Prediction Models,"We address the problem of comparing the risks of two given predictive models - for instance, a baseline model and a challenger - as confidently as possible on a fixed labeling budget. This problem occurs whenever models cannot be compared on held-out training data, possibly because the training data are unavailable or do not reflect the desired test distribution. In this case, new test instances have to be drawn and labeled at a cost. We devise an active comparison method that selects instances according to an instrumental sampling distribution. We derive the sampling distribution that maximizes the power of a statistical test applied to the observed empirical risks, and thereby minimizes the likelihood of choosing the inferior model. Empirically, we investigate model selection problems on several classification and regression tasks and study the accuracy of the resulting p-values."
1165,3861,2012,Learning Multiple Tasks using Shared Hypotheses,"In this work we consider a setting where we have a very large number   of related tasks with few examples from each individual task. Rather   than either learning each task individually (and having a large   generalization error) or learning all the tasks together using a   single hypothesis (and suffering a potentially large inherent   error), we consider learning a small pool of {\em shared     hypotheses}. Each task is then mapped to a single hypothesis in   the pool (hard association). We derive VC dimension generalization   bounds for our model, based on the number of tasks, shared   hypothesis and the VC dimension of the hypotheses   class. We conducted experiments with both synthetic problems and   sentiment of reviews, which strongly support our approach."
1166,3862,2012,Emergence of Object-Selective Features in Unsupervised Feature Learning,"Recent work in unsupervised feature learning has focused on the goal   of discovering high-level features from unlabeled images.  Much   progress has been made in this direction, but in most cases it is   still standard to use a large amount of labeled data in order to   construct detectors sensitive to object classes or other complex   patterns in the data.  In this paper, we aim to test the hypothesis   that unsupervised feature learning methods, provided with only   unlabeled data, can learn high-level, invariant features that are   sensitive to commonly-occurring objects.  Though a handful of prior   results suggest that this is possible when each object class   accounts for a large fraction of the data (as in many labeled   datasets), it is unclear whether something similar can be   accomplished when dealing with completely unlabeled data.  A major   obstacle to this test, however, is scale: we cannot expect to   succeed with small datasets or with small numbers of learned   features.  Here, we propose a large-scale feature learning system   that enables us to carry out this experiment, learning 150,000   features from tens of millions of unlabeled images.  Based on two   scalable clustering algorithms (K-means and agglomerative   clustering), we find that our simple system can discover features   sensitive to a commonly occurring object class (human faces) and can   also combine these into detectors invariant to significant global   distortions like large translations and scale."
1167,3863,2012,Approximate Message Passing with Consistent Parameter Estimation and Applications to Sparse Learning,"We consider the estimation of an i.i.d.\ vector $\xbf \in \R^n$ from measurements $\ybf \in \R^m$ obtained by a general cascade model consisting of a known linear transform followed by a probabilistic componentwise (possibly nonlinear) measurement channel. We present a method, called adaptive generalized approximate message passing (Adaptive GAMP), that enables joint learning of the statistics of the prior and measurement channel along with estimation of the unknown vector $\xbf$. The proposed algorithm is a generalization of a recently-developed method by Vila and Schniter that uses expectation-maximization (EM) iterations where the posteriors in the E-steps are computed via approximate message passing. The techniques can be applied to a large class of learning problems including the learning of sparse priors in compressed sensing or identification of linear-nonlinear cascade models in dynamical systems and neural spiking processes.  We prove that for large i.i.d.\ Gaussian transform matrices the asymptotic componentwise behavior of the adaptive GAMP algorithm is predicted by a simple set of scalar state evolution equations.  This analysis shows that the adaptive GAMP method can yield asymptotically consistent parameter estimates, which implies that the algorithm achieves a reconstruction quality equivalent to the oracle algorithm that knows the correct parameter values.  The adaptive GAMP methodology thus provides a systematic, general and computationally efficient method applicable to a large range of complex linear-nonlinear models with provable guarantees."
1168,3864,2012,Structured Learning of Gaussian Graphical Models,"We consider estimation of multiple high-dimensional Gaussian graphical models corresponding to a single set of nodes under several distinct conditions. We assume that most aspects of the networks are shared, but that there are some structured differences between them. Specifically, the network differences are generated from node perturbations: a few nodes are perturbed across networks, and most or all edges stemming from such nodes differ between networks. This corresponds to a simple model for the mechanism underlying many cancers, in which the gene regulatory network is disrupted  due to the aberrant activity of a few specific genes. We propose to solve this problem using the structured joint graphical lasso, a convex optimization problem that is based upon the use of a novel symmetric overlap norm penalty, which we solve using  an alternating directions method of multipliers algorithm. Our proposal is illustrated on synthetic data and on an application to brain cancer gene expression data."
1169,3867,2012,Dimensionality Dependent PAC-Bayes Margin Bound,"Margin is one of the most important concepts in machine learning. Previous margin bounds, both for SVM and for boosting, are dimensionality independent. A major advantage of this dimensionality independency is that it can explain the excellent performance of SVM whose feature spaces are often of high or infinite dimension. In this paper we address the problem whether such dimensionality independency is intrinsic for the margin bounds. We prove a dimensionality dependent PAC-Bayes margin bound. The bound is monotone increasing with respect to the dimension when keeping all other factors fixed. We show that our bound is strictly sharper than a previously well-known PAC-Bayes margin bound if the feature space is of finite dimension; and the two bounds tend to be equivalent as the dimension goes to infinity. In addition, we show that the VC bound for linear classifiers can be recovered from our bound under mild conditions. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and find that the new bound is useful for model selection and is significantly sharper than the dimensionality independent PAC-Bayes margin bound as well as the VC bound for linear classifiers."
1170,3868,2012,Simultaneously Leveraging Output and Task Structures for Multiple-Output Regression,"Multiple-output regression models require estimating multiple functions, one for each output. To improve parameter estimation in such models, methods based on structural regularization of the model parameters are usually needed. In this paper, we present a multiple-output regression model that leverages the covariance structure of the functions (i.e., how the multiple functions are related with each other) as well as the conditional covariance structure of the outputs. This is in contrast with existing methods that usually take into account only one of these structures. More importantly, unlike most of the other existing methods, none of these structures need be known a priori in our model, and are learned from the data. Several previously proposed structural regularization based  multiple-output regression models turn out to be special cases of our model. Moreover, in addition to being a rich model for multiple-output regression, our model can also be used in estimating the graphical model structure of a set of variables (multivariate outputs) conditioned on another set of variables (inputs). Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."
1171,3869,2012,High-Order Multi-Task Feature Learning to Identify Longitudinal Phenotypic Markers for Alzheimer's Disease Progression Prediction,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive impairment of memory and other cognitive functions. Regression analysis has been studied to relate neuroimaging measures to cognitive status. However, whether these measures have further predictive power to infer a trajectory of cognitive performance over time is still an under-explored but important topic in AD research. We propose a novel high-order multi-task learning model to address this issue. The proposed model explores the temporal correlations existing in data features and regression tasks by the structured sparsity-inducing norms. In addition, the sparsity of the model enables the selection of a small number of MRI measures while maintaining high prediction accuracy. The empirical studies, using the baseline MRI and serial cognitive data of the ADNI cohort, have yielded promising results."
1172,3870,2012,"The Lov?sz ? function, SVMs and finding large dense subgraphs","The Lovasz $\theta$ function of a graph, is a fundamental tool in combinatorial optimization and approximation algorithms.  Computing $\theta$ involves solving a SDP  and is extremely expensive even for moderately sized graphs.  In this paper we establish that the Lovasz $\theta$ function is equivalent to  a kernel learning problem related to one class SVM. This interesting connection opens up many opportunities  bridging graph theoretic algorithms and machine learning.   We show that there exist graphs, which we call $SVM-\theta$ graphs, on which the Lovasz $\theta$ function can be approximated well by a one-class  SVM.    This leads to a novel use of SVM techniques to solve algorithmic problems in large graphs e.g. identifying a planted clique  of size $\Theta({\sqrt{n}})$ in a random graph $G(n,\frac{1}{2})$. A classic approach for this problem involves computing  the $\theta$ function, however it is not scalable due to SDP computation. We show that the random graph with a planted clique is an example of $SVM-\theta$ graph, and as a consequence a SVM based approach  easily identifies the clique in large graphs and is competitive with the  state-of-the-art.    Further, we introduce  the notion of a ''common orthogonal labeling'' which extends the notion  of a ''orthogonal labelling of a single  graph (used in defining the $\theta$ function)  to multiple graphs.  The problem of finding the optimal common orthogonal labelling is cast as a  Multiple Kernel Learning problem and is used to identify a large common dense region in multiple graphs.  The proposed algorithm achieves an order of magnitude scalability compared to the state of the art."
1173,3871,2012,Recovery of Sparse Probability Measures via Convex Programming,"We consider the problem of cardinality penalized optimization of a convex function over the probability simplex with additional convex constraints. It's well-known that the classical L1 regularizer fails to promote sparsity on the probability simplex since L1 norm on the probability simplex is trivially constant. We propose a direct relaxation of the minimum cardinality problem and show that it can be efficiently solved using convex programming. As a first application we consider recovering a sparse probability measure given moment constraints, in which our formulation becomes linear programming, hence can be solved very efficiently. A sufficient condition for exact recovery of the minimum cardinality solution is derived for arbitrary affine constraints. We then develop a penalized version for the noisy setting which can be solved using second order cone programs. The proposed method outperforms known heuristics based on L1 norm. As a second application we consider convex clustering using a sparse Gaussian mixture and compare our results with the well known soft k-means algorithm."
1174,3872,2012,Privacy Aware Learning,"We study statistical risk minimization problems under a version of privacy in which the data is kept confidential even from the learner.  In this local privacy framework, we show sharp upper and lower bounds on the convergence rates of statistical estimation procedures. As a consequence, we exhibit a precise tradeoff between the amount of privacy the data preserves and the utility, measured by convergence rate, of any statistical estimator."
1175,3873,2012,Multiplicative Forests for Continuous-Time Processes,"Learning temporal dependencies between variables over continuous time is an important and challenging task. Continuous-time Bayesian networks effectively model such processes but are limited by the number of conditional intensity matrices, which grows exponentially in the number of parents per variable. We develop a partition-based representation using regression trees and forests whose parameter spaces grow linearly in the number of node splits. Using a multiplicative assumption we show how to update the forest likelihood in closed form, producing efficient model updates. Our results show multiplicative forests can be learned from few temporal trajectories with large gains in performance and scalability."
1176,3874,2012,Dual-Space Analysis of the Sparse Linear Model,"Sparse linear (or generalized linear) models combine a standard likelihood function with a sparse prior on the unknown coefficients.  These priors can conveniently be expressed as a maximization over zero-mean Gaussians with different variance hyperparameters.  Standard MAP estimation (Type I) involves maximizing over both the hyperparameters and coefficients, while an empirical Bayesian alternative (Type II) first marginalizes the coefficients and then maximizes over the hyperparameters, leading to a tractable posterior approximation.  The underlying cost functions can be related via a dual-space framework from Wipf et al. (2011), which allows both the Type I or Type II objectives to be expressed in either coefficient or hyperparmeter space.  This perspective is useful because some analyses or extensions are more conducive to development in one space or the other.  Herein we consider the estimation of a trade-off parameter balancing sparsity and data fit.  As this parameter is effectively a variance, natural estimators exist by assessing the problem in hyperparameter (variance) space, transitioning natural ideas from Type II to solve what is much less intuitive for Type I.  In contrast, for analyses of update rules and sparsity properties of local and global solutions, as well as extensions to more general likelihood models, we can leverage coefficient-space techniques developed for Type I and apply them to Type II.  For example, this allows us to prove that Type II-inspired techniques can be successful recovering sparse coefficients when unfavorable restricted isometry properties (RIP) lead to failure of popular L1 reconstructions. It also facilitates the analysis of Type II when non-Gaussian likelihood models lead to intractable integrations."
1177,3875,2012,Supervised Learning with Similarity Functions,"We address the problem of general supervised learning when data can only be accessed through an (indefinite) similarity function between data points. Existing work on learning with indefinite kernels has concentrated solely on binary/multiclass classification problems. We propose a model that is generic enough to handle any supervised learning task and also subsumes the model previously proposed for classification. We give a ''goodness'' criterion for similarity functions w.r.t. a given supervised learning task and then adapt a well-known landmarking technique to provide efficient algorithms for supervised learning using ''good'' similarity functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on three important supervised learning problems: a) real-valued regression, b) ordinal regression and c) ranking where we show that our method guarantees bounded generalization error. Furthermore, for the case of real-valued regression, we give a natural goodness definition that, when used in conjunction with a recent result in sparse vector recovery, guarantees a sparse predictor with bounded generalization error. Finally, we report results of our learning algorithms on regression and ordinal regression tasks using non-PSD similarity functions and demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms, especially that of the sparse landmark selection algorithm that achieves significantly higher accuracies than the baseline methods while offering reduced computational costs."
1178,3876,2012,Query Complexity of Derivative-Free Optimization,"Derivative Free Optimization (DFO) is attractive when the objective function's derivatives are not available and evaluations are costly.   Moreover, if the function evaluations are noisy, then approximating gradients by finite differences is difficult.  This paper gives quantitative lower bounds on the performance of DFO with noisy function evaluations, exposing a fundamental and unavoidable gap between optimization performance based on noisy evaluations versus noisy gradients. This challenges the conventional wisdom that the method of finite differences is comparable to a stochastic gradient.  However, there are situations in which DFO is unavoidable, and for such situations we propose a new DFO algorithm that is proved to be near optimal for the class of strongly convex objective functions.  A distinctive feature of the algorithm is that it only uses Boolean-valued function comparisons, rather than evaluations.  This makes the algorithm useful in an even wider range of applications, including optimization based on paired comparisons from human subjects, for example.  Remarkably, we show that regardless of whether DFO is based on noisy function evaluations or Boolean-valued function comparisons, the convergence rate is the same."
1179,3878,2012,Reducing statistical time-series problems to binary classification,"We  show how binary classification methods developed to work on i.i.d. data can be  used for solving  statistical problems that are seemingly unrelated to classification and concern highly-dependent time series.  Specifically, the problems of time-series  clustering, homogeneity testing and the three-sample problem  are addressed. The algorithms that we construct for solving  these problems are based on a new metric between time-series distributions, which can be evaluated using binary classification methods.  Universal consistency of the  proposed algorithms  is proven under most general assumptions. The theoretical results are illustrated with experiments on synthetic and real-world data."
1180,3879,2012,On Lifting the Gibbs Sampling Algorithm,"Statistical relational learning models combine the power of first-order logic, the de facto tool for handling relational structure, with that of probabilistic graphical models, the de facto tool for handling uncertainty. Lifted probabilistic inference algorithms for them have been the subject of much recent research. The main idea in these algorithms is to improve the speed, accuracy and scalability of existing graphical models' inference algorithms by exploiting symmetry in the first-order representation. In this paper, we consider blocked Gibbs sampling, an advanced variation of the classic Gibbs sampling algorithm and lift it to the first-order level. We propose to achieve this by partitioning the first-order atoms in the relational model into a set of disjoint clusters such that exact lifted inference is polynomial in each cluster given an assignment to all other atoms not in the cluster. We propose an approach for constructing such clusters and determining their complexity and show how it can be used to trade accuracy with computational complexity in a principled manner. Our experimental evaluation shows that lifted Gibbs sampling is superior to the propositional algorithm in terms of accuracy and convergence."
1181,3880,2012,Affine Independent Variational Inference,"We present a method for approximate inference for a broad class of non-conjugate probabilistic models. In particular, for the family of generalized linear model target densities we describe a rich class of variational approximating densities which can be best fit to the target by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence.  Our approach is based on using the Fourier representation which we show results in efficient and scalable inference."
1182,3883,2012,Strategic Impatience in Go/NoGo versus Forced-Choice Decision-Making,"Two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) and Go/NoGo (GNG) tasks are behavioral choice paradigms commonly used to study sensory and cognitive processing in choice behavior. While GNG is thought to isolate the sensory/decisional component by removing the need for response selection, a consistent bias towards the Go response (higher hits and false alarm rates) in the GNG task suggests possible fundamental differences in the sensory or cognitive processes engaged in the two tasks. Existing mechanistic models of these choice tasks, mostly variants of the drift-diffusion model (DDM; [1,2]) and the related leaky competing accumulator models [3,4] capture various aspects of behavior but do not address the provenance of the Go bias.  We postulate that this ``impatience'' to go is a strategic adjustment in response to the implicit asymmetry in the cost structure of GNG: the NoGo response requires waiting until the response deadline, while a Go response immediately terminates the current trial. We show that a Bayes-risk minimizing decision policy that minimizes both error rate and average decision delay naturally exhibits the experimentally observed bias.  The optimal decision policy is formally equivalent to a DDM with a time-varying threshold that initially rises after stimulus onset, and collapses again near the response deadline. The initial rise is due to the fading temporal advantage of choosing the Go response over the fixed-delay NoGo response. We show that fitting a simpler, fixed-threshold DDM to the optimal model reproduces the counterintuitive result of a higher threshold in GNG than 2AFC decision-making, previously observed in direct DDM fit to behavioral data [2], although such approximations cannot reproduce the Go bias. Thus, observed discrepancies between GNG and 2AFC decision-making may arise from rational strategic adjustments to the cost structure, and need not imply additional differences in the underlying sensory and cognitive processes."
1183,3885,2012,Meta-Gaussian Information Bottleneck,"We present a reformulation of the information bottleneck (IB) problem in terms of copula, using the equivalence between mutual information and negative copula  entropy. Focusing on the Gaussian copula we extend the analytical IB solution available for the multivariate Gaussian case to distributions with a Gaussian dependence structure but arbitrary marginal densities, also called meta-Gaussian distributions. This opens new possibles applications of IB to continuous data and provides a solution more robust to outliers."
1184,3886,2012,Factoring nonnegative matrices with linear programs,"This paper describes a new approach for computing nonnegative matrix factorizations (NMFs) with linear programming. The key idea is a data-driven model for the factorization, in which the most salient features in the data are used to express the remaining features.  More precisely, given a data matrix X, the algorithm identifies a matrix C that satisfies X = CX and some linear constraints.  The matrix C selects features, which are then used to compute a low-rank NMF of X.  A theoretical analysis demonstrates that this approach has the same type of guarantees as the recent NMF algorithm of Arora et al.~(2012).  In contrast with this earlier work, the proposed method has (1) better noise tolerance, (2) extends to more general noise models, and (3) leads to efficient, scalable algorithms.  Experiments with synthetic and real datasets provide evidence that the new approach is also superior in practice.  An optimized C++ implementation of the new algorithm can factor a multi-Gigabyte matrix in a matter of minutes."
1185,3887,2012,Adaptive Stratified Sampling for Monte-Carlo integration of Differentiable functions,"We consider the problem of adaptive stratified sampling for Monte Carlo integration of a differentiable function given a finite number of evaluations to the function. We construct a sampling scheme that samples more often in regions where the function oscillates more, while allocating the samples such that they are well spread on the domain (this notion shares similitude with low discrepancy). We prove that the estimate returned by the algorithm is almost as accurate as the estimate that an optimal oracle strategy (that would know the variations of the function everywhere) would return, and we provide a finite-sample analysis."
1186,3889,2012,Mandatory Leaf Node Prediction in Hierarchical Multilabel Classification,"In hierarchical classification, the prediction paths may be required to always end at leaf nodes. This is called mandatory leaf node prediction (MLNP) and is particularly useful when the leaf nodes have much stronger semantic meaning than the internal nodes. However, while there have been a lot of MLNP methods in hierarchical multiclass classification, performing MLNP in hierarchical multilabel classification is much more difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel MLNP algorithm that (i) considers the global hierarchy structure; and (ii) can  be used on hierarchies of both trees and DAGs. We show that one can efficiently maximize the joint posterior probability of all the node labels by a simple greedy algorithm. Moreover, this can be further extended to the minimization of the expected symmetric loss. Experiments are performed on a number of real-world data sets with tree- and DAG-structured label hierarchies. The  proposed method consistently outperforms other hierarchical and flat multilabel classification methods."
1187,3890,2012,Bayesian estimation of discrete entropy with mixtures of stick-breaking priors,"We consider the problem of estimating Shannon's entropy H in the   under-sampled regime, where the number of possible symbols may be   unknown or countably infinite.  Pitman-Yor processes (a   generalization of Dirichlet processes) provide tractable prior   distributions over the space of countably infinite discrete   distributions, and have found major applications in Bayesian   non-parametric statistics and machine learning. Here we show that   they also provide natural priors for Bayesian entropy estimation,   due to the remarkable fact that the moments of the induced posterior   distribution over H can be computed analytically. We derive   formulas for the posterior mean (Bayes' least squares estimate) and   variance under such priors.  Moreover, we show that a fixed   Dirichlet or Pitman-Yor process prior implies a narrow prior on H,   meaning the prior strongly determines the entropy estimate in the   under-sampled regime. We derive a family of continuous mixing   measures such that the resulting mixture of Pitman-Yor processes   produces an approximately flat (improper) prior over H.  We   explore the theoretical properties of the resulting estimator, and   show that it performs well on data sampled from both exponential and   power-law tailed distributions."
1188,3891,2012,Practical Bayesian Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms,"The use of machine learning algorithms frequently involves careful tuning of learning parameters and model hyperparameters. Unfortunately, this tuning is often a ?black art? requiring expert experience, rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search. There is therefore great appeal for automatic approaches that can optimize the performance of any given learning algorithm to the problem at hand. In this work, we consider this problem through the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm?s generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). We show that certain choices for the nature of the GP, such as the type of kernel and the treatment of its hyperparameters, can play a crucial role in obtaining a good optimizer that can achieve expert-level performance. We describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning algorithm experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization for many algorithms including Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks."
1189,3892,2012,A quasi-Newton proximal splitting method,"We describe efficient implementations of the proximity calculation for a useful class of functions; the implementations exploit the piece-wise linear nature of the dual problem. The second part of the paper applies the previous result to acceleration of convex minimization problems, and leads to an elegant quasi-Newton method. The optimization method compares favorably against state-of-the-art alternatives. The algorithm has extensive applications including signal processing, sparse regression and recovery, and machine learning and classification."
1190,3893,2012,A Polylog Pivot Steps Simplex Algorithm for Classification,"We present a simplex algorithm for linear programming in a linear classification formulation. The paramount complexity parameter in linear classification problems is called the margin. We prove that for margin values of practical interest our simplex variant performs a polylogarithmic number of pivot steps in the worst case, and its overall running time is near linear. This is in contrast to general linear programming, for which no sub-polynomial pivot rule is known."
1191,3894,2012,Patient Risk Stratification for Hospital-Associated C. diff as a Time-Series Classification Task,"A patient's risk for adverse events is affected by temporal processes including the nature and timing of diagnostic and therapeutic activities, and the overall evolution of the patient's pathophysiology over time. Yet many investigators ignore this temporal aspect when modeling patient risk, considering only the patient's current or aggregate state. We explore representing patient risk as a time series. In doing so, patient risk stratification becomes a time-series classification task. The task differs from most applications of time-series analysis, like speech processing, since the time series itself must first be extracted. Thus, we begin by defining and extracting approximate \textit{risk processes}, the evolving approximate daily risk of a patient. Once obtained, we use these signals to explore different approaches to time-series classification with the goal of identifying high-risk patterns. We apply the classification to the specific task of identifying patients at risk of testing positive for hospital acquired colonization with \textit{Clostridium Difficile}. We achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.79 on a held-out set of several hundred patients. Our two-stage approach to risk stratification outperforms classifiers that consider only a patient's current state (p$<$0.05)."
1192,3895,2012,Deep Spatio-Temporal Architectures and Learning for Protein Structure Prediction,"Residue-residue contact prediction is a fundamental problem in protein structure prediction. Hower, despite considerable research efforts, contact prediction methods are still largely unreliable. Here we introduce a novel deep machine-learning architecture which consists of a multidimensional stack of learning modules. For contact prediction, the idea is implemented as a three-dimensional stack of Neural Networks NN^k_{ij}, where i and j index the spatial coordinates of the contact map and k indexes ''time''. The temporal dimension is introduced to capture the fact that protein folding is not an instantaneous process, but rather a progressive refinement. Networks at level k in the stack can be trained in supervised fashion to refine the predictions produced by the previous level, hence addressing the problem of vanishing gradients, typical of deep architectures. Increased accuracy and generalization capabilities of this approach are established by rigorous comparison with other classical machine learning approaches for contact prediction. The deep approach leads to an accuracy for difficult long-range contacts of about 30%, roughly 10% above the state-of-the-art. Many variations in the architectures and the training algorithms are possible, leaving room for further improvements. Furthermore, the approach is applicable to other problems with strong underlying spatial and temporal components."
1193,3896,2012,Synchronization can Control Regularization in Neural Systems via Correlated Noise Processes,"To learn reliable rules that can generalize to novel situations, the brain must be capable of imposing some form of regularization. Here we suggest, through theoretical and computational arguments, that the combination of noise with synchronization provides a plausible mechanism for regularization in the nervous system. The functional role of regularization is considered in a general context in which coupled computational systems receive inputs corrupted by correlated noise. Noise on the inputs is shown to impose regularization, and when synchronization upstream induces time-varying correlations across noise variables, the degree of regularization can be calibrated over time. The resulting qualitative behavior matches experimental data from visual cortex."
1194,3897,2012,Classification Calibration Dimension for General Multiclass Losses,"We study consistency properties of surrogate loss functions for general multiclass classification problems, defined by a general loss matrix. We extend the notion of classification calibration, which has been studied for binary and multiclass 0-1 classification problems (and for certain other specific learning problems), to the general multiclass setting, and derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a surrogate loss to be classification calibrated with respect to a loss matrix in this setting. We then introduce the notion of \emph{classification calibration dimension} of a multiclass loss matrix, which measures the smallest `size' of a prediction space for which it is possible to design a convex surrogate that is classification calibrated with respect to the loss matrix. We derive both upper and lower bounds on this quantity, and use these results to analyze various loss matrices. In particular, as one application, we provide a different route from the recent result of Duchi et al.\ (2010) for analyzing the difficulty of designing `low-dimensional' convex surrogates that are consistent with respect to pairwise subset ranking losses. We anticipate the classification calibration dimension may prove to be a useful tool in the study and design of surrogate losses for general multiclass learning problems."
1195,3898,2012,Interpreting prediction markets: a stochastic approach,"We strengthen recent connections between prediction markets and learning by showing that a natural class of market makers can be understood as performing stochastic mirror descent when trader demands are sequentially drawn from a fixed distribution. This provides new insights into how market prices (and price paths) may be interpreted as a summary of the market's belief distribution by relating them to the optimization problem being solved. In particular, we show that the stationary point of the stochastic process of prices generated by the market is equal to the market's Walrasian equilibrium of classic market analysis. Together, these results suggest how traditional market making mechanisms might be replaced with general purpose learning algorithms while still retaining guarantees about their behaviour."
1196,3900,2012,Latent Graphical Model Selection: Efficient Methods for Locally Tree-like Graphs,"Graphical model selection refers to the problem of estimating the unknown graph structure given observations at the nodes in the model. We consider a challenging instance of this problem when some of the nodes are latent or hidden.  We  characterize  conditions for tractable graph estimation and develop efficient methods with provable guarantees. We consider the class of Ising models Markov on  locally tree-like graphs, which are in the regime of correlation decay. We  propose an efficient method for graph estimation, and establish its structural consistency when the number of samples $n$ scales as $n = \Omega(\theta_{\min}^{-\delta \eta(\eta+1)-2}\log p)$, where $\theta_{\min}$ is the minimum edge potential, $\delta$ is the depth (i.e., distance from a hidden node to the nearest  observed nodes), and $\eta$ is a parameter which depends on the minimum and maximum node and edge potentials in the Ising model. The proposed method is practical to implement and provides  flexibility to control  the number of latent variables and the cycle lengths in the output graph.  We also present necessary conditions for graph estimation by any method and show that our method nearly matches the lower bound  on sample requirements."
1197,3901,2012,Sparse Approximate Manifolds for Differential Geometric MCMC,"One of the enduring challenges in Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology is the development of proposal mechanisms to make moves distant from the current point, that are accepted with high probability and at low computational cost. The recent introduction of locally adaptive MCMC methods based on the natural underlying Riemannian geometry of such models goes some way to alleviating these problems for certain classes of models for which the metric tensor is analytically tractable, however computational efficiency is not assured due to the necessity of potentially high-dimensional matrix operations at each iteration. In this paper we firstly investigate a sampling-based approach for approximating the metric tensor and suggest a valid MCMC algorithm that extends the applicability of Riemannian Manifold MCMC methods to statistical models that do not admit an analytically computable metric tensor. Secondly, we show how the approximation scheme we consider naturally motivates the use of l1 regularisation to improve estimates and obtain a sparse approximate inverse of the metric, which enables stable and sparse approximations of the local geometry to be made. We demonstrate the application of this algorithm for inferring the parameters of a realistic system of ordinary differential equations using a biologically motivated robust student-t error model, for which the expected Fisher Information is analytically intractable."
1198,3902,2012,Learning to Discover Social Circles in Ego Networks,"Our personal social networks are big and cluttered, and currently there is no good way to organize them. Social networking sites allow users to manually categorize their friends into social circles (e.g. `circles' on Google+, and `lists' on Facebook and Twitter), however they are laborious to construct and must be updated whenever a user's network grows. We define a novel machine learning task of identifying users' social circles. We pose the problem as a node clustering problem on a user's ego-network, a network of connections between her friends. We develop a model for detecting circles that combines network structure as well as user profile information. For each circle we learn its members and the circle-specific user profile similarity metric. Modeling node membership to multiple circles allows us to detect overlapping as well as hierarchically nested circles. Experiments show that our model accurately identifies circles on a diverse set of data from Facebook, Google+, and Twitter for all of which we obtain hand-labeled ground-truth data."
1199,3903,2012,Perceptron Learning of SAT,"Boolean satisfiability (SAT) as a canonical NP-complete decision problem is one of the most important problems in computer science.  In practice, real-world SAT sentences are drawn from a distribution that may result in efficient algorithms for their solution. Such SAT instances are likely to have shared characteristics and substructures. This work approaches the exploration of a family of SAT solvers as a learning problem.  In particular, we relate polynomial time solvability of a SAT subset to a notion of margin between sentences mapped by a feature function into a Hilbert space.  Provided this mapping is based on polynomial time computable statistics of a sentence, we show that the existance of a margin between these data points implies the existance of a polynomial time solver for that SAT subset based on the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland algorithm.  Furthermore, we show that a simple perceptron-style learning rule will find an optimal SAT solver with a bounded number of training updates.  We derive a linear time computable set of features and show analytically that margins exist for important polynomial special cases of SAT.  Empirical results show an order of magnitude improvement over a state-of-the-art SAT solver on a hardware verification task."
1200,3904,2012,Truncation-free Online Variational Inference for Bayesian Nonparametric Models,"We present a truncation-free online variational inference algorithm for Bayesian nonparametric models. Unlike traditional (online) variational inference algorithms that require truncations for the model or the variational distribution, our method adapts model complexity on the fly. Our experiments for Dirichlet process mixture models and hierarchical Dirichlet process topic models on two large-scale data sets show better performance than previous online variational inference algorithms."
1201,3905,2012,Fast Bayesian Inference for Non-Conjugate Gaussian Process Regression,"We present a new variational inference algorithm for Gaussian processes with non-conjugate likelihood functions. This includes binary and multi-class classification, as well as ordinal regression. Our method constructs a convex lower bound, which can be optimized by using an efficient fixed point update method. We then show empirically that our new approach is much faster than existing methods without any degradation in performance."
1202,3906,2012,A Nonparametric Conjugate Prior Distribution for the Maximizing Argument of a Noisy Function,"We propose a novel Bayesian approach to solve stochastic optimization problems that involve ?nding extrema of noisy, nonlinear functions. Previous work has focused on representing possible functions explicitly, which leads to a two-step procedure of ?rst, doing inference over the function space and second, ?nding the extrema of these functions. Here we skip the representation step and directly model the distribution over extrema. To this end, we devise a non-parametric conjugate prior where the natural parameter corresponds to a given kernel function and the suf?cient statistic is composed of the observed function values. The resulting posterior distribution directly captures the uncertainty over the maximum of the unknown function."
1203,3907,2012,Sparse Prediction with the ,"We derive a novel norm that corresponds to the tightest convex   relaxation of sparsity combined with an $\ell_2$ penalty. We show   that this new norm provides a tighter relaxation than the elastic   net, and is thus a good replacement for the Lasso or the elastic net   in sparse prediction problems.  But through studying our new norm,   we also bound the looseness of the elastic net, thus shedding new   light on it and providing justification for its use."
1204,3908,2012,A Convex Formulation for Learning Scale-Free Networks via Submodular Relaxation,"A key problem in statistics and machine learning is the determination of network structure from data. We consider the case where the structure of the graph to be reconstructed is known to be scale-free. We show that in such cases it is natural to formulate structured sparsity inducing priors using submodular functions, and we use their Lovasz extension to obtain a convex relaxation. For tractable classes such as Gaussian graphical models, this leads to a convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved. We show that our method results in an improvement in the accuracy of reconstructed networks for synthetic data. We also show how our prior encourages scale-free reconstructions on a bioinfomatics dataset."
1205,3909,2012,A Geometric take on Metric Learning,"Multi-metric learning techniques learn local metric tensors in different parts of a feature space. With such an approach, even simple classifiers can be competitive with the state-of-the-art because the distance measure locally adapts to the structure of the data. The learned distance measure is, however, non-metric, which has prevented multi-metric learning from generalizing to tasks such as dimensionality reduction and regression in a principled way. We prove that, with appropriate changes, multi-metric learning corresponds to learning the structure of a Riemannian manifold. We then show that this structure gives us a principled way to perform dimensionality reduction and regression according to the learned metrics. Algorithmically, we provide the first practical algorithm for computing geodesics according to the learned metrics, as well as algorithms for computing exponential and logarithmic maps on the Riemannian manifold. Together, these tools let many Euclidean algorithms take advantage of multi-metric learning. We illustrate the approach on regression and dimensionality reduction tasks that involve predicting measurements of the human body from shape data."
1206,3911,2012,Sketch-Based Linear Value Function Approximation,"Hashing is a common method to reduce large, potentially infinite feature vectors to a fixed-size table. In reinforcement learning, hashing is often used in conjunction with tile coding to represent states in continuous spaces. Hashing is also a promising approach to value function approximation in large discrete domains such as Go and Hearts, where feature vectors can be constructed by exhaustively combining a set of atomic features. Unfortunately, the typical use of hashing in value function approximation results in biased value estimates due to the possibility of collisions. Recent work in data stream summaries has led to the development of the tug-of-war sketch, an unbiased estimator for approximating inner products. Our work investigates the application of this new data structure to linear value function approximation. Although in the reinforcement learning setting the use of the tug-of-war sketch leads to biased value estimates, we show that this bias can be orders of magnitude less than that of standard hashing. We provide empirical results on two RL benchmark domains and fifty-five Atari 2600 games to highlight the superior learning performance of tug-of-war hashing."
1207,3912,2012,Causal discovery with scale-mixture model for spatiotemporal variance dependencies,"In conventional causal discovery, structural equation models (SEM) are directly applied to the observed variables, meaning that the causal effect can be represented as a function of the direct causes themselves. However, in many real world problems, there are significant dependencies in the variances or energies, which indicates that causality may possibly take place at the level of variances or energies. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic causal scale-mixture model with spatiotemporal variance dependencies to represent a specific type of generating mechanism of the observations. In particular, the causal mechanism including contemporaneous and temporal causal relations in variances or energies is represented by a Structural Vector AutoRegressive model (SVAR). We prove the identifiability of this model under the non-Gaussian assumption on the innovation processes. We also propose algorithms to estimate the involved parameters and discover the contemporaneous causal structure. Experiments on synthesis and real world data are conducted to show the applicability of the proposed model and algorithms."
1208,3914,2012,Optimal Regularized Dual Averaging Methods for Stochastic Optimization,"This paper considers a wide spectrum of regularized stochastic optimization problems where both the loss function and regularizer can be non-smooth.  We develop a novel algorithm based on the regularized dual averaging (RDA) method, that can simultaneously achieve the optimal convergence rates for both convex and strongly convex loss. In particular, for strongly convex loss, it achieves the optimal  rate of $O(\frac{1}{N}+\frac{1}{N^2})$ for $N$  iterations, which improves the best known rate $O(\frac{\log N }{N})$ of previous stochastic dual averaging algorithms. In addition, our method constructs the final solution directly from the proximal mapping instead of averaging of all previous iterates. For widely used sparsity-inducing regularizers (e.g., $\ell_1$-norm), it has the advantage of encouraging sparser solutions. We further develop a multi-stage extension using the proposed algorithm as a subroutine, which achieves the uniformly-optimal rate $O(\frac{1}{N}+\exp\{-N\})$ for strongly convex loss."
1209,3915,2012,Learning the Architecture of Sum-Product Networks Using Clustering on Variables,"The sum-product network (SPN) is a recently-proposed deep model consisting of a network of sum and product nodes, and has been shown to be competitive with state-of-the-art deep models on certain difficult tasks such as image completion. Designing an SPN network architecture that is suitable for the task at hand is an open question. We propose an algorithm for learning the SPN architecture from data. The idea is to cluster variables (as opposed to data instances) in order to identify variable subsets that strongly interact with one another. Nodes in the SPN network are then allocated towards explaining these interactions. Experimental evidence shows that learning the SPN architecture significantly improves its performance compared to using a previously-proposed static architecture."
1210,3916,2012,Imitation Learning by Coaching,"Imitation Learning has been shown to be successful in solving many challenging real-world problems. Some recent approaches give strong performance guarantees by training the policy iteratively. However, it is important to note that these guarantees depend on   how well the policy we found can imitate the oracle on the training data.  When there is a substantial difference between the oracle's ability  and the learner's policy space, we may fail to find a policy that has low error on the training set. In such cases, we propose to use a coach that demonstrates easy-to-learn actions for the learner  and gradually approaches the oracle. By a reduction of learning by demonstration to online learning,  we prove that coaching can yield a lower regret bound than using the oracle. We apply our algorithm to a novel cost-sensitive dynamic feature selection problem, a hard decision problem that considers a user-specified accuracy-cost trade-off.  Experimental results on UCI datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art imitation learning methods in dynamic features selection and two static feature selection methods."
1211,3917,2012,A Divide-and-Conquer Method for Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation,"In this paper, we consider the $\ell_1$ regularized sparse inverse covariance matrix estimation problem with a very large number of variables. Even in the face of this high dimensionality, and with limited number of samples, recent work has shown this estimator to have strong statistical guarantees in recovering the true structure of the sparse inverse covariance matrix, or alternatively the underlying graph structure of the corresponding Gaussian Markov Random Field. Our proposed algorithm divides the problem into  smaller sub-problems, and uses the solutions of the sub-problems to build a good approximation for the original problem. We derive a bound on the distance of the approximate solution to the true solution. Based on this bound, we propose a clustering algorithm that attempts to minimize this bound, and in practice, is able to find effective partitions of the variables. We further use the approximate solution, i.e., solution resulting from solving the sub-problems,  as an initial point to solve the original problem, and achieve a much faster computational procedure.  As an example, a recent state-of-the-art method, QUIC requires 10 hours to solve a problem (with 10,000 nodes) that arises from a climate application, while our proposed algorithm, Divide and Conquer QUIC (DC-QUIC) only requires one hour to solve the problem."
1212,3918,2012,Non-parametric Approximate Dynamic Programming via the Kernel Method,"This paper presents a novel non-parametric approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm that enjoys graceful, dimension-independent approximation and sample complexity guarantees. In particular, we establish both theoretically and computationally that our proposal can serve as a viable alternative to state-of-the-art parametric ADP algorithms, freeing the designer from carefully specifying an approximation architecture. We accomplish this by developing a kernel-based mathematical program for ADP. Via a computational study on a controlled queueing network, we show that our non-parametric procedure is competitive with parametric ADP approaches."
1213,3919,2012,A Simple and Practical Algorithm for Differentially Private Data Release,"We present a new algorithm for differentially private data release, based on a simple combination of the Exponential Mechanism with the Multiplicative Weights update rule.  Our MWEM algorithm achieves what are the best known and nearly optimal theoretical guarantees, while at the same time being simple to implement and experimentally more accurate on actual data sets than existing techniques."
1214,3920,2012,Multiple Choice Learning: Learning to Produce Multiple Structured Outputs,"The paper addresses the problem of generating multiple hypotheses for prediction tasks that involve interaction with users or successive components in a cascade. Given a set of multiple hypotheses, such components/users have the ability to automatically rank the results and thus retrieve the best one. The standard approach for handling this scenario is to learn a single model and then produce M-best Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) hypotheses from this model. In contrast, we formulate this multiple {\em choice} learning task as a multiple-output structured-output prediction problem with a loss function that captures the natural setup of the problem. We present a max-margin formulation  that minimizes an upper-bound on this loss-function. Experimental results on the problems of image co-segmentation and protein side-chain prediction show that our method outperforms conventional approaches used for this  scenario and leads to substantial improvements in prediction accuracy."
1215,3922,2012,Finite Sample Convergence Rates of Zero-Order Stochastic Optimization Methods,"We consider derivative-free algorithms for stochastic optimization problems that use only noisy function values rather than gradients, analyzing their finite-sample convergence rates. We show that if pairs of function values are available, algorithms that use gradient estimates based on random perturbations suffer a factor of at most $\sqrt{\dim}$ in convergence rate over traditional stochastic gradient methods, where $\dim$ is the dimension of the problem. We complement our algorithmic development with information-theoretic lower bounds on the minimax convergence rate of such problems, which show that our bounds are sharp with respect to all problem-dependent quantities: they cannot be improved by more than constant factors."
1216,3923,2012,Inverse Reinforcement Learning through Structured Classification,"This paper adresses the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem, that is inferring a reward for which a demonstrated expert behavior is optimal. We introduce a new algorithm, SCIRL, whose principle is to use the so-called feature expectation of the expert as the parameterization of the score function of a multi-class classifier. This approach produces a reward function for which the expert policy is provably near-optimal. Contrary to most of existing IRL algorithms, SCIRL does not require solving the direct RL problem. Moreover, with an appropriate heuristic, it can succeed with only trajectories sampled according to the expert behavior. This is illustrated on a car driving simulator."
1217,3924,2012,Bayesian active learning with localized priors for fast receptive field characterization,"Active learning can substantially improve the yield of neurophysiology experiments by adaptively selecting stimuli to probe a neuron's receptive field (RF) in real time. Bayesian active learning methods maintain a posterior distribution over the RF, and select stimuli to maximally reduce posterior entropy on each time step.  However, existing methods tend to rely on simple Gaussian priors, and do not exploit uncertainty at the level of hyperparameters when determining an optimal stimulus.  This uncertainty can play a substantial role in RF characterization, particularly when RFs are smooth, sparse, or local in space and time.  In this paper, we describe a novel framework for active learning under hierarchical, conditionally Gaussian priors.  Our algorithm uses sequential Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling (''particle filtering'' with MCMC) over hyperparameters to construct a mixture-of-Gaussians representation of the RF posterior, and selects optimal stimuli using an approximate infomax criterion.  The core elements of this algorithm are parallelizable, making it computationally efficient for real-time experiments.  We apply our algorithm to simulated and real neural data, and show that it can provide highly accurate receptive field estimates from very limited data, even with a small number of hyperparameter samples."
1218,3925,2012,Learning High-Density Regions for a Generalized Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test in High-Dimensional Data,"We propose an efficient, generalized, nonparametric, statistical Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for detecting distributional change in high-dimensional data. To implement the test, we introduce a novel, hierarchical, minimum-volume sets estimator to represent the distributions to be tested. Our work is motivated by the need to detect changes in data streams, and the test is especially efficient in this context. We provide the theoretical foundations of our test and show its superiority over existing methods."
1219,3926,2012,Slice Normalized Dynamic Markov Logic Networks,"Markov logic is a widely used tool in statistical relational learning, which uses a weighted first-order logic knowledge base to specify a Markov random field (MRF) or a conditional random field (CRF). In many applications, a Markov logic network (MLN) is trained in one domain, but used in a different one. This paper focuses on dynamic Markov logic networks, where the domain of time points typically varies between training and testing. It has been previously pointed out that the marginal probabilities of truth assignments to ground atoms can change if one extends or reduces the domains of predicates in an MLN. We show that in addition to this problem, the standard way of unrolling a Markov logic theory into a MRF may result in time-inhomogeneity of the underlying Markov chain. Furthermore, even if these representational problems are not significant for a given domain, we show that the more practical problem of generating samples in a sequential conditional random field for the next slice relying on the samples from the previous slice has high computational cost in the general case, due to the need to estimate a normalization factor for each sample. We propose a new discriminative model, slice normalized dynamic Markov logic networks (SN-DMLN), that suffers from none of these issues. It supports efficient online inference, and can directly model influences between variables within a time slice that do not have a causal direction, in contrast with fully directed models (e.g., DBNs). Experimental results show an improvement in accuracy over previous approaches to online inference in dynamic Markov logic networks."
1220,3927,2012,Complex Inference in Neural Circuits with Probabilistic Population Codes and Topic Models,"Recent experiments have demonstrated that humans and animals typically reason probabilistically about their environment. This ability requires a neural code that represents probability distributions and neural circuits that are capable of implementing the operations of probabilistic inference. The proposed probabilistic population coding (PPC) framework provides a statistically efficient neural representation of probability distributions that is both broadly consistent with physiological measurements and capable of implementing some of the basic operations of probabilistic inference in a biologically plausible way. However, these experiments and the corresponding neural models have largely focused on simple (tractable) probabilistic computations such as cue combination, coordinate transformations, and decision making. As a result it remains unclear how to generalize this framework to more complex probabilistic computations. Here we address this short coming by showing that a very general approximate inference algorithm known as Variational Bayesian Expectation Maximization can be implemented within the linear PPC framework. We apply this approach to a generic problem faced by any given layer of cortex, namely the identification of latent causes of complex mixtures of spikes. We identify a formal equivalent between this spike pattern demixing problem and topic models used for document classification, in particular Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We then construct a neural network implementation of variational inference and learning for LDA that utilizes a linear PPC. This network relies critically on two non-linear operations: divisive normalization and super-linear facilitation, both of which are ubiquitously observed in neural circuits. We also demonstrate how online learning can be achieved using a variation of Hebb?s rule and describe an extesion of this work which allows us to deal with time varying and correlated latent causes."
1221,3928,2012,Learned Prioritization for Trading Off Accuracy and Speed,"Users want natural language processing (NLP) systems to be both fast and accurate, but quality often comes at the cost of speed. The field has been manually exploring various speed-accuracy tradeoffs (for particular problems and datasets).  We aim to explore this space automatically, focusing here on the case of agenda-based syntactic parsing \cite{kay-1986}. Unfortunately, off-the-shelf reinforcement learning techniques fail to learn good policies: the state space is simply too large to explore naively. An attempt to counteract this by applying imitation learning algorithms also fails: the ``teacher'' is far too good to successfully imitate with our inexpensive features.  Moreover, it is not specifically tuned for the known reward function.  We propose a hybrid reinforcement/apprenticeship learning algorithm that, even with only a few inexpensive features, can automatically learn weights that achieve competitive accuracies at significant improvements in speed over state-of-the-art baselines."
1222,3929,2012,Putting Bayes to sleep,"We consider sequential prediction algorithms that are given the predictions from a set of models as inputs. If the nature of the data is changing over time in that different models predict well on different segments of the data, then adaptivity is typically achieved by mixing into the weights in each round a bit of the initial prior (kind of like a weak restart). However, what if the favored models in each segment are from a small subset, i.e. the data is likely to be predicted well by models that predicted well before? Curiously, fitting such ''sparse composite models'' is achieved by mixing in a bit of all the past posteriors. This self-referential updating method is rather peculiar, but it is efficient and gives superior performance on many natural data sets. Also it is important because it introduces a long-term memory: any model that has done well in the past can be recovered quickly. While Bayesian interpretations can be found for mixing in a bit of the initial prior, no Bayesian interpretation is known for mixing in past posteriors.  We build atop the ''specialist'' framework from the online learning literature to give the Mixing Past Posteriors update a proper Bayesian foundation. We apply our method to a well-studied multitask learning problem and obtain a new intriguing efficient update that achieves a significantly better bound."
1223,3930,2012,A Polynomial-time Form of Robust Regression,"Despite the variety of robust regression methods that have been developed, current regression formulations are either NP-hard, or allow unbounded response to even a single leverage point. We present a general formulation for robust regression --Variational M-estimation--that unifies a number of robust regression methods while allowing a tractable approximation strategy. We develop an estimator that requires only polynomial-time, while achieving certain robustness and consistency guarantees. An experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the new estimation approach  compared to standard methods."
1224,3931,2012,Multi-Task Averaging,"We present a multi-task learning approach to jointly estimate the means of multiple independent data sets. The proposed multi-task averaging (MTA) algorithm results in a convex combination of the single-task averages. We derive the optimal amount of regularization, and show that it can be effectively estimated. Simulations and real data experiments demonstrate that MTA  both maximum likelihood and James-Stein estimators, and that our approach to estimating the amount of regularization rivals cross-validation in performance but is more computationally efficient."
1225,3933,2012,Semi-supervised Eigenvectors for Locally-biased Learning,"In many applications, one has information, e.g., labels that are  provided in a semi-supervised manner, about a specific target region of a  large data set, and one wants to perform machine learning and data analysis  tasks nearby that pre-specified target region.   Locally-biased problems of this sort are particularly challenging for  popular eigenvector-based machine learning and data analysis tools. At root, the reason is that eigenvectors are inherently global quantities. In this paper, we address this issue by providing a methodology to construct  semi-supervised eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian, and we illustrate  how these locally-biased eigenvectors can be used to perform  locally-biased machine learning. These semi-supervised eigenvectors capture successively-orthogonalized  directions of maximum variance, conditioned on being well-correlated with an  input seed set of nodes that is assumed to be provided in a semi-supervised  manner. We also provide several empirical examples demonstrating how these  semi-supervised eigenvectors can be used to perform locally-biased learning."
1226,3934,2012,Feature-aware Label Space Dimension Reduction for Multi-label Classification,"Label space dimension reduction (LSDR) is an efficient and effective paradigm for multi-label classification with many classes. Existing approaches to LSDR, such as compressive sensing and principal label space transformation, exploit only the label part of the dataset, but not the feature part. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to LSDR that considers both the label and the feature parts. The approach, called conditional principal label space transformation, is based on minimizing an upper bound of the popular Hamming loss. The minimization step of the approach can be carried out efficiently by a simple use of singular value decomposition. In addition, the approach can be extended to a kernelized version that allows the use of sophisticated feature combinations to assist LSDR. The experimental results verify that the proposed approach is more effective than existing ones to LSDR across many real-world datasets."
1227,3935,2012,3D Object Detection and Viewpoint Estimation with a Deformable 3D Cuboid Model,"This paper addresses the problem of category-level 3D object detection. Given a monocular image, our aim is to localize the objects  in 3D by enclosing them with tight  oriented 3D bounding boxes. We propose a novel approach that extends the well-acclaimed deformable part-based model[Felz.] to reason in 3D. Our model represents an object class as a deformable 3D cuboid composed of faces and parts, which are both allowed to deform with respect to their anchors on the 3D box. We model the appearance of each face in fronto-parallel coordinates, thus effectively factoring out the appearance variation induced by viewpoint. Our model reasons about face visibility patters called aspects. We train the cuboid model jointly and discriminatively and share weights across all aspects to attain efficiency. Inference then entails sliding and rotating the box in 3D and scoring object hypotheses. While for inference we discretize the search space, the variables are  continuous in our model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in indoor and outdoor scenarios, and show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in both 2D[Felz09] and 3D object detection[Hedau12]."
1228,3936,2012,Distributed Non-Stochastic Experts,"We consider the online distributed non-stochastic experts problem, where the distributed system consists of one coordinator node that is connected to k sites, and the sites are required to communicate with each other via the coordinator. At each time-step t, one of the k site nodes has to pick an expert from the set {1, . . . , n}, and the same site receives information about payoffs of all experts for that round. The goal of the distributed system is to minimize regret at time horizon T, while simultaneously keeping communication to a minimum. The two extreme solutions to this problem are: (i) Full communication: This essentially simulates the non-distributed setting to obtain the optimal O(\sqrt{log(n)T}) regret bound at the cost of T communication. (ii) No communication: Each site runs an independent copy ? the regret is O(\sqrt{log(n)kT}) and the communication is 0. This paper shows the difficulty of simultaneously achieving regret asymptotically better than \sqrt{kT} and communication better than T. We give a novel algorithm that for an oblivious adversary achieves a non-trivial trade-off: regret O(\sqrt{k^{5(1+\epsilon)/6} T}) and communication O(T/k^\epsilon), for any value of \epsilon in (0, 1/5). We also consider a variant of the model, where the coordinator picks the expert. In this model, we show that the label-efficient forecaster of Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2005) already gives us strategy that is near optimal in regret vs communication trade-off."
1229,3937,2012,On Triangular versus Edge Representations --- Towards Scalable Modeling of Networks,"In this paper, we argue for representing networks as a bag of {\it triangular motifs}, particularly for important network problems that current model-based approaches handle poorly due to computational bottlenecks incurred by using edge representations. Such approaches require both 1-edges and 0-edges (missing edges) to be provided as input, and as a consequence, approximate inference algorithms for these models usually require $\Omega(N^2)$ time per iteration, precluding their application to larger real-world networks. In contrast, triangular modeling requires less computation, while providing equivalent or better inference quality. A triangular motif is a vertex triple containing 2 or 3 edges, and the number of such motifs is $\Theta(\sum_{i}D_{i}^{2})$ (where $D_i$ is the degree of vertex $i$), which is much smaller than $N^2$ for low-maximum-degree networks. Using this representation, we develop a novel mixed-membership network model and approximate inference algorithm suitable for large networks with low max-degree. For networks with high maximum degree, the triangular motifs can be naturally subsampled in a {\it node-centric} fashion, allowing for much faster inference at a small cost in accuracy. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach, when compared to that of an edge-based model, has faster runtime and improved accuracy for mixed-membership community detection. We conclude with a large-scale demonstration on an $N\approx 280,000$-node network, which is infeasible for network models with $\Omega(N^2)$ inference cost."
1230,3938,2012,Near-optimal Differentially Private Principal Components,"Principal components analysis (PCA) is a standard tool for identifying good low-dimensional approximations to data sets in high dimension.  Many current data sets of interest contain private or sensitive information about individuals.  Algorithms which operate on such data should be sensitive to the privacy risks in publishing their outputs.  Differential privacy is a framework for developing tradeoffs between privacy and the utility of these outputs.  In this paper we investigate the theory and empirical performance of differentially private approximations to PCA and propose a new method which explicitly optimizes the utility of the output.  We demonstrate that on real data, there this a large performance gap between the existing methods and our method.  We show that the sample complexity for the two procedures differs in the scaling with the data dimension, and that our method is nearly optimal in terms of this scaling."
1231,3939,2012,Communication/Computation Tradeoffs in Consensus-Based Distributed Optimization,"We study the scalability of consensus-based distributed optimization algorithms by considering two questions: How many processors should we use for a given problem, and how often should they communicate when communication is not free? Central to our analysis is a problem-specific value $r$ which quantifies the communication/computation tradeoff. We show that organizing the communication among nodes as a $k$-regular expander graph~\cite{kRegExpanders} yields speedups, while when all pairs of nodes communicate (as in a complete graph), there is an optimal number of processors that depends on $r$. Surprisingly, a speedup can be obtained, in terms of the time to reach a fixed level of accuracy, by communicating less and less frequently as the computation progresses. Experiments on a real cluster solving metric learning and non-smooth convex minimization tasks demonstrate strong agreement between theory and practice."
1232,3940,2012,Fully Bayesian inference for neural models with negative-binomial spiking,"Characterizing the information carried by neural populations in the brain requires accurate statistical models of neural spike responses.  The negative-binomial distribution provides a convenient model for over-dispersed spike counts, that is, responses with greater-than-Poisson variability.  Here we describe a powerful data-augmentation framework for fully Bayesian inference in neural models with negative-binomial spiking. Our approach relies on a recently described latent-variable representation of the negative-binomial distribution, which equates it to a Polya-gamma mixture of normals.  This framework provides a tractable, conditionally Gaussian representation of the posterior that can be used to design efficient EM and Gibbs sampling based algorithms for inference in regression and dynamic factor models.  We apply the model to neural data from primate retina and show that it substantially outperforms Poisson regression on held-out data, and reveals latent structure underlying spike count correlations in simultaneously recorded spike trains."
1233,3941,2012,Dynamic Pruning of Factor Graphs for Maximum Marginal Prediction,"We study the problem of maximum marginal prediction (MMP) in probabilistic graphical models, a task that occurs, for example, as the Bayes optimal decision rule under a Hamming loss. MMP is typically performed as a two-stage procedure: one estimates each variable's marginal probability and then forms a prediction from the states of maximal probability. In this work we propose a simple yet effective technique for accelerating MMP when inference is sampling-based: instead of the above two-stage procedure we directly estimate the posterior probability of each decision variable. This allows us to identify the point of time when we are sufficiently certain about any individual decision. Whenever this is the case, we dynamically prune the variable we are confident about from the underlying factor graph. Consequently, at any time only samples of variable whose decision is still uncertain need to be created. Experiments in two prototypical scenarios, multi-label classification and image inpainting, shows that adaptive sampling can drastically accelerate MMP without sacrificing prediction accuracy."
1234,3942,2012,Efficient Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization in Games with Many Player Actions,"Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) is a popular, iterative algorithm for computing strategies in extensive-form games. The Monte Carlo CFR (MCCFR) variants reduce the per iteration time cost of CFR by traversing a sampled portion of the tree. The previous most effective instances of MCCFR can still be very slow in games with many player actions since they sample every action for a given player. In this paper, we present a new MCCFR algorithm, Average Strategy Sampling (AS), that samples a subset of the player's actions according to the player's average strategy. Our new algorithm is inspired by a new, tighter bound on the number of iterations required by CFR to converge to a given solution quality. In addition, we prove a similar, tighter bound for AS and other popular MCCFR variants. Finally, we validate our work by demonstrating that AS converges faster than previous MCCFR algorithms in both no-limit poker and Bluff."
1235,3945,2012,Online L1-Dictionary Learning with Application to Novel Document Detection,"Given their pervasive use, social media, such as Twitter, have become a leading source of breaking news. A key task in the automated identification of such news is the detection of novel documents from a voluminous stream of text documents in a scalable manner. Motivated by this challenge, we introduce the problem of online L1-dictionary learning where unlike traditional dictionary learning, which uses squared loss, the L1-penalty is used for measuring the reconstruction error. We present an efficient online algorithm for this problem based on alternating directions method of multipliers, and establish a sublinear regret bound for this algorithm. Empirical results on news-stream and Twitter data, shows that this online L1-dictionary learning algorithm for novel document detection gives more than an order of magnitude speedup over the previously known batch algorithm, without any significant loss in quality of results. Our algorithm for online L1-dictionary learning could be of independent interest."
1236,3947,2012,Scalable Inference of Overlapping Communities,"We develop a scalable algorithm for posterior inference of overlapping communities in large networks.  Our algorithm is based on stochastic variational inference in the mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel. It naturally interleaves subsampling the network with estimating its community structure.  We apply our algorithm on ten large, real-world networks with up to 60,000 nodes. It converges several orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm for MMSB, finds hundreds of communities in large real-world networks, and detects the true communities in 280 benchmark networks with equal or better accuracy compared to other scalable algorithms."
1237,3948,2012,Iterative Thresholding Algorithm for Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation,"Sparse graphical modelling/inverse covariance selection is an important problem in machine learning and has seen significant advances in recent years. A major focus has been on methods which perform model selection in high dimensions. To this end, numerous convex $\ell_1$ regularization approaches have been proposed in the literature. It is not however clear which of these methods are optimal in any well-defined sense. A major gap in this regard pertains to the rate of convergence of proposed optimization methods. To address this, an iterative thresholding algorithm for numerically solving the $\ell_1$-penalized maximum likelihood problem for sparse inverse covariance estimation is presented. The proximal gradient method considered in this paper is shown to converge at a linear rate, a result which is the first of its kind for numerically solving the sparse inverse covariance estimation problem. The convergence rate is provided in closed form, and is related to the condition number of the optimal point. Numerical results demonstrating the proven rate of convergence are presented."
1238,3949,2012,Selective Labeling via Error Bound Minimization,"In many practical machine learning problems, the acquisition of labeled data is often expensive and/or time consuming. This motivates us to study a problem as follows: given a label budget, how to select data points to label such that the learning performance is optimized. We propose a selective labeling method by analyzing the generalization error of Laplacian regularized Least Squares (LapRLS). In particular, we derive a deterministic generalization error bound for LapRLS trained on subsampled data, and propose to select a subset of data points to label by minimizing this upper bound. Since the minimization is a combinational problem, we relax it into continuous domain and solve it by projected gradient descent. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."
1239,3950,2012,A Unifying Perspective of Parametric Policy Search Methods for Markov Decision Processes,"Parametric policy search algorithms are one of the methods of choice for the optimisation of Markov Decision Processes, with Expectation Maximisation and natural gradient ascent being considered the current state of the art in the field. In this article we provide a unifying perspective of these two algorithms by showing that their step-directions in the parameter space are closely related to the search direction of an approximate Newton method. This analysis leads naturally to the consideration of this approximate Newton method as an alternative gradient-based method for Markov Decision Processes. We are able show that the algorithm has numerous desirable properties, absent in the naive application of Newton's method, that make it a viable alternative to either Expectation Maximisation or natural gradient ascent. Empirical results suggest that the algorithm has excellent convergence and robustness properties, performing strongly in comparison to both Expectation Maximisation and natural gradient ascent."
1240,3951,2012,Near-Optimal MAP Inference for Determinantal Point Processes,"Determinantal point processes (DPPs) have recently been proposed as   computationally efficient probabilistic models of diverse sets for a   variety of applications, including document summarization, image   search, and pose estimation.  Many DPP inference operations,   including normalization and sampling, are tractable; however,   finding the most likely configuration (MAP), which is often required   in practice for decoding, is NP-hard, so we must resort to   approximate inference.  Because DPP probabilities are   log-submodular, greedy algorithms have been used in the past with   some empirical success; however, these methods only give   approximation guarantees in the special case of DPPs with monotone   kernels.  In this paper we propose a new algorithm for approximating   the MAP problem based on continuous techniques for submodular   function maximization.  Our method involves a novel continuous   relaxation of the log-probability function, which, in contrast to   the multilinear extension used for general submodular functions, can   be evaluated and differentiated exactly and efficiently.  We obtain   a practical algorithm with a 1/4-approximation guarantee for a   general class of non-monotone DPPs.  Our algorithm also extends to   MAP inference under complex polytope constraints, making it possible   to combine DPPs with Markov random fields, weighted matchings, and   other models.  We demonstrate that our approach outperforms greedy   methods on both synthetic and real-world data."
1241,3952,2012,Approximating Concavely Parameterized Optimization Problems,"We consider an abstract class of optimization problems that are parameterized concavely in a single parameter, and show that the solution path along the parameter can always be approximated with accuracy $\varepsilon >0$ by a set of size $O(1/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$. A lower bound of size $\Omega (1/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ shows that the upper bound is tight up to a constant factor. We also devise an algorithm that calls a step-size oracle and computes an approximate path of size $O(1/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$. Finally, we provide an implementation of the oracle for soft-margin support vector machines, and a parameterized semi-definite program for matrix completion."
1242,3953,2012,A nonparametric variable clustering model,"Factor analysis models effectively summarise the covariance structure of high dimensional data, but the solutions are typically hard to interpret. This motivates attempting to find a disjoint partition, i.e. a clustering, of observed variables so that variables in a cluster are highly correlated. We introduce a Bayesian non-parametric approach to this problem, and demonstrate advantages over heuristic methods proposed to date."
1243,3955,2012,Hierarchical Optimistic Region Selection driven by Curiosity,"This paper aims to take a step forwards making the term ``intrinsic motivation'' from reinforcement learning theoretically well founded, focusing on curiosity-driven learning. To that end, we consider the setting where, a fixed partition P of a continuous space X being given, and a process \nu defined on X being unknown, we are asked to sequentially decide which cell of the partition to select as well as where to sample \nu in that cell, in order to minimize a loss function that is inspired from previous work on curiosity-driven learning. The loss on each cell consists of one term measuring a simple worst case quadratic sampling error, and a penalty term proportional to the range of the variance in that cell. The corresponding problem formulation extends the setting known as active learning for multi-armed bandits to the case when each arm is a continuous region, and we show how an adaptation of recent algorithms for that problem and of hierarchical optimistic sampling algorithms for optimization can be used in order to solve this problem. The resulting procedure, called Hierarchical Optimistic Region SElection driven by Curiosity (HORSE.C) is provided together with a finite-time regret analysis."
1244,3957,2012,Learning Networks of Heterogeneous Influence,"Information, disease, and influence diffuse over networks of entities in both natural systems and human society. Analyzing these transmission networks plays an important role in understanding the diffusion processes and predicting events in the future. However, the underlying transmission networks are often hidden and incomplete, and we observe only the time stamps when cascades of events happen. In this paper, we attempt to address the challenging problem of uncovering the hidden network only from the cascades.  The structure discovery problem is complicated by the fact that the influence among different entities in a network are heterogeneous, which can not be described by a simple parametric model. Therefore, we propose a kernel-based method which can capture a diverse range of different types of influence without any prior assumption. In both synthetic and real cascade data, we show that our model can better recover the underlying diffusion network and drastically improve the estimation of the influence functions between networked entities."
1245,3958,2012,Symmetric Correspondence Topic Models for Multilingual Text Analysis,"Topic modeling is a widely used approach to analyzing large text collections. A small number of multilingual topic models have recently been explored to discover latent topics among parallel or comparable documents, such as in Wikipedia. Other topic models that were originally proposed for structured data are also applicable to multilingual documents. Correspondence Latent Dirichlet Allocation (CorrLDA) is one such model; however, it requires a pivot language to be specified in advance. We propose a new topic model, Symmetric Correspondence LDA (SymCorrLDA), that incorporates a hidden variable to control a pivot language, in an extension of CorrLDA. We experimented with two multilingual comparable datasets extracted from Wikipedia and demonstrate that SymCorrLDA is more effective than some other existing multilingual topic models."
1246,3960,2012,Multi-scale Hyper-time Hardware Emulation of Human Motor Nervous System Based on Spiking Neurons using FPGA,"Our central goal is to quantify the long-term progression of pediatric neurological diseases, such as a typical 10-15 years progression of child dystonia. To this purpose, quantitative models are convincing only if they can provide multi-scale details ranging from neuron spikes to limb biomechanics. The models also need to be evaluated in hyper-time, i.e. significantly faster than real-time, for producing useful predictions. We designed a platform with digital VLSI hardware for multi-scale hyper-time emulations of human motor nervous systems. The platform is constructed on a scalable, distributed array of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices. All devices operate asynchronously with 1 millisecond time granularity, and the overall system is accelerated to 365x real-time. Each physiological component is implemented using models from well documented studies and can be flexibly modified. Thus the validity of emulation can be easily advised by neurophysiologists and clinicians. For maximizing the speed of emulation, all calculations are implemented in combinational logic instead of clocked iterative circuits. This paper presents the methodology of building FPGA modules in correspondence to components of a monosynaptic spinal loop. Results of emulated activities are shown. The paper also discusses the rationale of approximating neural circuitry by organizing neurons with sparse interconnections. In conclusion, our platform allows introducing various abnormalities into the neural emulation such that the emerging motor symptoms can be analyzed. It compels us to test the origins of childhood motor disorders and predict their long-term progressions."
1247,3962,2012,Phoneme Classification using Constrained Variational Gaussian Process Dynamical System,"This paper describes a new acoustic model based on variational Gaussian process dynamical system (VGPDS) for phoneme classification. The proposed model overcomes the limitations of the classical HMM in modeling the real speech data, by adopting a nonlinear and nonparametric model. In our model, the GP prior on the dynamics function enables representing the complex dynamic structure of speech, while the GP prior on the emission function successfully models the global dependency over the observations. Additionally, we introduce variance constraint to the original VGPDS for mitigating sparse approximation error of the kernel matrix. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated with extensive experimental results including parameter estimation, classification performance on the synthetic and benchmark datasets."
1248,3963,2012,Nystr?m Method vs Random Fourier Features: A Theoretical and Empirical Comparison,"Both random Fourier features and the Nystr?m method have been successfully applied to efficient kernel learning. In this work, we investigate the fundamental difference between these two approaches, and how the difference could affect their generalization performances. Unlike approaches based on random Fourier features  where the basis functions (i.e., cosine and sine functions) are sampled from a distribution  {\it independent} from the training data, basis functions used by the Nystr?m method are randomly sampled from the training examples and are therefore {\it data dependent}. By exploring this difference, we show that when there is a large gap in the eigen-spectrum of the kernel matrix, approaches based the Nystr?m method can yield  impressively  better generalization error bound than random Fourier features based approach. We empirically verify our theoretical findings on a wide range of large data sets."
1249,3964,2012,Repulsive Mixtures,"Discrete mixtures are used routinely in broad sweeping applications ranging from unsupervised settings to fully supervised multi-task learning.  Indeed, finite mixtures and infinite mixtures, relying on Dirichlet processes and modifications, have become a standard tool.  One important issue that arises in using discrete mixtures is low separation in the components; in particular, different components can be introduced that are very similar and hence redundant.   Such redundancy leads to too many clusters that are too similar, degrading performance in unsupervised learning and leading to computational problems and an unnecessarily complex model in supervised settings.  Redundancy can arise in the absence of a penalty on components placed close together even when a Bayesian approach is used to learn the number of components.  To solve this problem, we propose a novel prior that generates components from a repulsive process, automatically penalizing redundant components.  We characterize this repulsive prior theoretically and propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm for posterior computation.  The methods are illustrated using synthetic examples and an iris data set."
1250,3966,2012,Kernel Latent SVM for Visual Recognition,"Latent SVMs (LSVMs) are a class of powerful tools that have been successfully applied to many applications in computer vision. However, a limitation of LSVMs is that they rely on linear models. For many computer vision tasks, linear models are suboptimal and nonlinear models learned with kernels typically perform much better. Therefore it is desirable to develop the kernel version of LSVM. In this paper, we propose kernel latent SVM (KLSVM) -- a new learning framework that combines latent SVMs and kernel methods. We develop an iterative training algorithm to learn the model parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of KLSVM using three different applications in visual recognition. Our KLSVM formulation is very general and can be applied to solve a wide range of applications in computer vision and machine learning."
1251,3967,2012,Multilabel Classification using Bayesian Compressed Sensing,"In this paper, we present a Bayesian framework for multilabel classification using compressed sensing. The key idea in compressed sensing for multilabel classification is to first project the label vector to a lower dimensional space using a random transformation and then learn regression functions over these projections. Our approach considers both of these components in a single probabilistic model, thereby jointly optimizing over compression as well as learning tasks. We then derive an efficient variational inference scheme that provides joint posterior distribution over all the unobserved labels. The two key benefits of the model are that a) it can naturally handle datasets that have  missing labels and b) it can also measure uncertainty in prediction. The uncertainty estimate provided by the model naturally allows for active learning paradigms where an oracle provides information about labels that promise to be maximally informative for the prediction task. Our experiments show significant boost over prior methods in terms of prediction performance over benchmark datasets, both in the fully labeled and the missing labels case.  Finally, we also highlight various useful active learning scenarios that are enabled by the probabilistic model."
1252,3968,2012,Kernel Hyperalignment,"We offer a regularized, kernel extension of the multi-set, orthogonal Procrustes problem, or hyperalignment. Our new method, called Kernel Hyperalignment, expands the scope of hyperalignment to include nonlinear measures of similarity and enables the alignment of multiple datasets with a large number of base features. With direct application to fMRI data analysis, kernel hyperalignment is well-suited for multi-subject alignment of large ROIs, including the entire cortex. We conducted experiments using real-world, multi-subject fMRI data."
1253,3969,2012,Homeostatic plasticity in Bayesian spiking networks as Expectation Maximization with posterior constraints,"Recent spiking network models of Bayesian inference and unsupervised learning frequently assume either inputs to arrive in a special format or employ complex computations in neuronal activation functions and synaptic plasticity rules. Here we show in a rigorous mathematical treatment how homeostatic processes, which have previously received little attention in this context, can overcome common theoretical limitations and facilitate the neural implementation and performance of existing models. In particular, we show that homeostatic plasticity can be understood as the enforcement of a 'balancing' posterior constraint during probabilistic inference and learning with Expectation Maximization. We link homeostatic dynamics to the theory of variational inference, and show that nontrivial terms, which typically appear during probabilistic inference in a large class of models, drop out. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in a spiking Winner-Take-All architecture of Bayesian inference and learning. Finally, we sketch how the mathematical framework can be extended to richer recurrent network architectures. Altogether, our theory provides a novel perspective on the interplay of homeostatic processes and synaptic plasticity in cortical microcircuits, and points to an essential role of homeostasis during inference and learning in spiking networks."
1254,3970,2012,Controlled Recognition Bounds for Visual Learning and Exploration,"We describe the tradeoff between the performance in a visual recognition problem and the control authority that the agent can exercise on the sensing process. We focus on the problem of ?visual search? of an object in an otherwise known and static scene, propose a measure of control authority, and relate it to the expected risk and its proxy (conditional entropy of the posterior density). We show this analytically, as well as empirically by simulation using the simplest known model that captures the phenomenology of image formation, including scaling and occlusions. We show that a ?passive? agent given a training set can provide no guarantees on performance beyond what is afforded by the priors, and that an ?omnipotent? agent, capable of infinite control authority, can achieve arbitrarily good performance (asymptotically)."
1255,3971,2012,Waveform Driven Plasticity in BiFeO3 Memristive Devices: Model and Implementation,"Memristive devices have recently been proposed as efficient implementations of plastic synapses in neuromorphic systems. The plasticity in these memristive devices, i.e. their resistance change, is defined by the applied waveforms. This behavior resembles biological synapses, whose plasticity is also triggered by mechanisms that are determined by local waveforms. However, learning in memristive devices has so far been approached mostly on a pragmatic technological level. The focus seems to be on finding any waveform that achieves spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), without regard to the biological veracity of said waveforms or to further important forms of plasticity. Bridging this gap, we make use of a plasticity model driven by neuron waveforms that explains a large number of experimental observations and adapt it to the characteristics of the recently introduced BiFeO$_3$ memristive material. Based on this approach, we show STDP for the first time for this material, with learning window replication superior to previous memristor-based STDP implementations. We also demonstrate in measurements that it is possible to overlay short and long term plasticity at a memristive device in the form of the well-known triplet plasticity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementations of triplet plasticity on any physical memristive device."
1256,3972,2012,Fused sparsity and robust estimation for linear models with unknown variance,"In this paper, we develop a novel approach to the problem of learning sparse representations in the context of fused sparsity and unknown noise level. We propose an algorithm, termed Scaled Fused Dantzig Selector (SFDS), that accomplishes the aforementioned learning task by means of a second-order cone program. A special  emphasize is put on the particular instance of fused sparsity corresponding to  the learning in presence of outliers. We establish finite sample risk bounds and  carry out an experimental evaluation on both synthetic and real data."
1257,3974,2012,A Linear Time Active Learning Algorithm for Link Classification,"We present very efficient active learning algorithms for link classification in signed networks. Our algorithms are motivated by a stochastic model in which edge labels are obtained through perturbations of a initial sign assignment consistent with a two-clustering of the nodes. We provide a theoretical analysis within this model, showing that we can achieve an optimal (to whithin a constant factor) number of mistakes on any graph $G = (V,E)$ such that $|E|$ is at least order of $|V|^{3/2}$ by querying at most order of $|V|^{3/2}$ edge labels. More generally, we show an algorithm that achieves optimality to within a factor of order $k$ by querying at most order of $|V| + (|V|/k)^{3/2}$ edge labels. The running time of this algorithm is at most of order $|E| + |V|\log|V|$."
1258,3975,2012,On-line Reinforcement Learning Using Incremental Kernel-Based Stochastic Factorization,"The ability to learn a policy for a sequential decision problem with continuous state space using on-line data is a long-standing challenge. This paper presents a new reinforcement-learning algorithm, called iKBSF, which extends the benefits of kernel-based learning to the on-line scenario. As a kernel-based method, the proposed algorithm is stable and has good convergence properties. However, unlike other similar algorithms,iKBSF's space complexity is independent of the number of sample transitions, and as a result it can process an arbitrary amount of data. We present theoretical results showing that iKBSF can approximate (to any level of accuracy) the value function that would be learned by an equivalent batch non-parametric kernel-based reinforcement learning approximator. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in practice, we apply iKBSF to the challenging three-pole balancing task, where the ability to process a large number of transitions is crucial for achieving a high success rate."
1259,3978,2012,"Compressive neural representation of sparse, high-dimensional probabilities","This paper shows how sparse, high-dimensional probability distributions could be represented by neurons with exponential compression. The representation is a novel application of compressive sensing to sparse probability distributions rather than to the usual sparse signals. The compressive measurements correspond to expected values of nonlinear functions of the probabilistically distributed variables. When these expected values are estimated by sampling, the quality of the compressed representation is limited only by the quality of sampling. Since the compression preserves the geometric structure of the space of sparse probability distributions, probabilistic computation can be performed in the compressed domain. Interestingly, functions satisfying the requirements of compressive sensing can be implemented as simple perceptrons. If we use perceptrons as a simple model of feedforward computation by neurons, these results show that the mean activity of a relatively small number of neurons can accurately represent a high-dimensional joint distribution implicitly, even without accounting for any noise correlations. This comprises a novel hypothesis for how neurons could encode probabilities in the brain."
1260,3979,2012,Newton-Like Methods for Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation,"We propose two classes of second-order optimization methods for solving the sparse inverse covariance estimation problem. The first approach, which we call the Newton-LASSO method, minimizes a piecewise quadratic model of the objective function at every iteration to generate a step. We employ the fast iterative shrinkage thresholding method (FISTA) to solve this subproblem. The second approach, which we call the Orthant-Based Newton method, is a two-phase algorithm that first identifies an orthant face and then minimizes a smooth quadratic approximation of the objective function using the conjugate gradient method.  These methods exploit the structure of the Hessian to efficiently compute the search direction and to avoid explicitly storing the Hessian.  We show that quasi-Newton methods are also effective in this context, and describe a limited memory BFGS variant of the orthant-based Newton method.  We present numerical results that suggest that all the techniques described in this paper have attractive properties and constitute useful tools for solving the sparse inverse covariance estimation problem. Comparisons with the method implemented in the QUIC software package are presented."
1261,3980,2012,Bayesian Pedigree Analysis using Measure Factorization,"Pedigrees, or family trees, are directed graphs used to identify sites of the genome that are correlated with the presence or absence of a disease.  With the advent of genotyping and sequencing technologies, there has been an explosion in the amount of data available, both in the number of individuals and in the number of sites.  Some pedigrees number in the thousands of individuals.  Meanwhile, analysis methods have remained limited to pedigrees of <100 individuals which limits analyses to many small independent pedigrees.  Disease models, such those used for the linkage analysis log-odds (LOD) estimator, have similarly been limited.  This is because linkage anlysis was originally designed with a different task in mind, that of ordering the sites in the genome, before there were technologies that could reveal the order.  LODs are difficult to interpret and nontrivial to extend to consider interactions among sites.  These developments and difficulties call for the creation of modern methods of pedigree analysis.  Drawing from recent advances in graphical model inference and transducer theory, we introduce a simple yet powerful formalism for expressing genetic disease models.   We show that these disease models can be turned into accurate and efficient estimators.  The technique we use for constructing the variational approximation has potential applications to inference in other large-scale graphical models.  This method allows inference on larger pedigrees than previously analyzed in the literature, which improves disease site prediction."
1262,3981,2012,"Provable ICA with Unknown Gaussian Noise, with Implications for Gaussian Mixtures and Autoencoders","We present a new algorithm for Independent Component Analysis (ICA) which has provable performance guarantees. In particular, suppose we are given samples of the form $y = Ax + \eta$ where $A$ is an unknown $n \times n$ matrix and $x$ is chosen uniformly at random from $\{+1, -1\}^n$, $\eta$ is an $n$-dimensional Gaussian random variable with unknown covariance $\Sigma$: We give an algorithm that provable recovers $A$ and $\Sigma$ up to an additive $\epsilon$ whose running time and sample complexity are polynomial in $n$ and $1 / \epsilon$. To accomplish this, we introduce a novel ``quasi-whitening'' step that may be useful in other contexts in which the covariance of Gaussian noise is not known in advance. We also give a general framework for finding all local optima of a function (given an oracle for approximately finding just one) and this is a crucial step in our algorithm, one that has been overlooked in previous attempts, and allows us to control the accumulation of error when we find the columns of $A$ one by one via local search."
1263,3982,2012,Minimizing Uncertainty in Pipelines,"In this paper, we consider the problem of debugging large pipelines by human labeling. We represent the execution of a pipeline using a directed acyclic graph of AND and OR nodes, where each node represents a data item produced by some operator in the pipeline. We assume that each operator assigns a confidence to each of its output data. We want to reduce the uncertainty in the output by issuing queries to a human expert, where a query consists of checking if a given data item is correct. In this paper, we consider the problem of asking the optimal set of queries to minimize the resulting output uncertainty. We perform a detailed evaluation of the complexity of the problem for various classes of graphs. We give efficient algorithms for the problem for trees, and show that, for a general dag, the problem is intractable."
1264,3983,2012,Learning as MAP Inference in Discrete Graphical Models,"We present a new formulation for attacking binary classification problems. Instead of relying on convex losses and regularisers such as in SVMs, logistic regression and boosting, or instead non-convex but continuous formulations such as those encountered in neural networks and deep belief networks, our framework entails a non-convex but \emph{discrete} formulation, where estimation amounts to finding a MAP configuration in a graphical model whose potential functions are low-dimensional discrete surrogates for the misclassification loss. We argue that such a discrete formulation can naturally account for a number of issues that are typically encountered in either the convex or the continuous non-convex paradigms, or both. By reducing the learning problem to a MAP inference problem, we can immediately translate the guarantees available for many inference settings to the learning problem itself. We empirically demonstrate in a number of experiments that this approach is promising in dealing with issues such as severe label noise, while still having global optimality guarantees. Due to the discrete nature of the formulation, it also allows for \emph{direct} regularisation through cardinality-based penalties, such as the $\ell_0$ pseudo-norm, thus providing the ability to perform feature selection and trade-off interpretability and predictability in a principled manner. We also outline a number of open problems arising from the formulation."
1265,3984,2012,Truly Nonparametric Online Variational Inference for Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes,"Variational methods provide a computationally scalable alternative to Monte Carlo methods for large-scale, Bayesian nonparametric learning.  In practice, however, conventional batch and online variational methods quickly become trapped in local optima. In this paper, we consider a nonparametric topic model based on the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP), and develop a novel online variational inference algorithm based on split-merge topic updates. We derive a simpler and faster variational approximation of the HDP, and show that by intelligently splitting and merging components of the variational posterior, we can achieve substantially better predictions of test data than conventional online and batch variational algorithms. For streaming analysis of large datasets where batch analysis is infeasible, we show that our split-merge updates better capture the nonparametric properties of the underlying model, allowing continual learning of new topics."
1266,3985,2012,Fiedler Random Fields: A Large-Scale Spectral Approach to Statistical Network Modeling,"Statistical models for networks have been typically committed to strong prior assumptions concerning the form of the modeled distributions. Moreover, the vast majority of currently available models are explicitly designed for capturing some specific graph properties (such as power-law degree distributions), which makes them unsuitable for application to domains where the behavior of the target quantities is not known a priori. The key contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce the Fiedler delta statistic, based on the Laplacian spectrum of graphs, which allows to dispense with any parametric assumption concerning the modeled network properties. Second, we use the defined statistic to develop the Fiedler random field model, which allows for efficient estimation of edge distributions over large-scale random networks. After analyzing the dependence structure involved in Fiedler random fields, we estimate them over several real-world networks, showing that they achieve a much higher modeling accuracy than other well-known statistical approaches."
1267,3986,2012,A systematic approach to extracting semantic information from functional MRI data,"This paper introduces a novel classification method for functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets with tens of classes. The method is designed to make predictions using information from as many brain locations as possible, instead of resorting to feature selection, and does this by decomposing the pattern of brain activation into differently informative sub-regions. We provide results over a complex semantic processing dataset that show that the method is competitive with state-of-the-art feature selection and also suggest how the method may be used to perform group or exploratory analyses of complex class structure."
1268,3987,2012,Bayesian models for Large-scale Hierarchical Classification,"A challenging problem in hierarchical classification is to leverage the hierarchical relations among classes for  improving classification performance. An even greater challenge is to do so in a manner that is computationally feasible for the large scale problems usually encountered in practice. This paper proposes a set of Bayesian methods to model hierarchical dependencies among class labels using multivari- ate logistic regression. Specifically, the parent-child relationships are modeled by placing a hierarchical prior over the children nodes centered around the parame- ters of their parents; thereby encouraging classes nearby in the hierarchy to share similar model parameters. We present new, efficient variational algorithms for tractable posterior inference in these models, and provide a parallel implementa- tion that can comfortably handle large-scale problems with hundreds of thousands of dimensions and tens of thousands of classes. We run a comparative evaluation on multiple large-scale benchmark datasets that highlights the scalability of our approach, and shows a significant performance advantage over the other state-of- the-art hierarchical methods."
1269,3989,2012,A Better Way to Pretrain Deep Boltzmann Machines,"We describe how the pre-training algorithm for Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBMs) is related to the pre-training algorithm for Deep Belief Networks and we show that under certain conditions, the pre-training procedure improves the variational lower bound of a two-hidden-layer DBM. Based on this analysis, we develop a different method of pre-training DBMs that distributes the modelling work more evenly over the hidden layers. Our results on the MNIST and NORB datasets demonstrate that the new pre-training algorithm allows us to learn better generative models."
1270,3990,2012,Gradient Weights help Nonparametric Regressors,"In regression problems over $\real^d$, the unknown function $f$ often varies more in some coordinates than in others. We show that weighting each coordinate $i$ with the estimated norm of the $i$th derivative of $f$  is an efficient way to significantly improve the performance of distance-based regressors, e.g. kernel and $k$-NN regressors.  We propose a simple estimator of these derivative norms and prove its consistency. Moreover, the proposed  estimator is efficiently learned online."
1271,3991,2012,Multi-criteria Anomaly Detection using Pareto Depth Analysis,"We consider the problem of identifying patterns in a data set that exhibit anomalous behavior, often referred to as anomaly detection. In most anomaly detection algorithms, the dissimilarity between data samples is calculated by a single criterion, such as Euclidean distance. However, in many cases there may not exist a single dissimilarity measure that captures all possible anomalous patterns. In such a case, multiple criteria can be defined, and one can test for anomalies by scalarizing the multiple criteria by taking some linear combination of them. If the importance of the different criteria are not known in advance, the algorithm may need to be executed multiple times with different choices of weights in the linear combination. In this paper, we introduce a novel non-parametric multi-criteria anomaly detection method using Pareto depth analysis (PDA). PDA uses the concept of Pareto optimality to detect anomalies under multiple criteria without having to run an algorithm multiple times with different choices of weights. The proposed PDA approach scales linearly in the number of criteria and is provably better than linear combinations of the criteria."
1272,3992,2012,A Neural Autoregressive Topic Model,"We describe a new model for learning meaningful representations of text documents from an unlabeled collection of documents. This model is inspired by the recently proposed Replicated Softmax, an undirected graphical model of word counts that was shown to learn a better generative model and more meaningful document representations. Specifically, we take inspiration from the conditional mean-field recursive equations of the Replicated Softmax in order to define a neural network architecture that estimates the probability of observing a new word in a given document given the previously observed words. This paradigm also allows us to replace the expensive softmax distribution over words with a hierarchical distribution over paths in a binary tree of words. The end result is a model whose training complexity scales logarithmically with the vocabulary size instead of linearly as in the Replicated Softmax. Our experiments show that our model is competitive both as a generative model of documents and as a document representation learning algorithm."
1273,3993,2012,Monte Carlo Methods for Maximum Margin Supervised Topic Models,"An effective strategy to exploit the supervising side information for discovering predictive topic representations is to impose discriminative constraints induced by such information on the posterior distributions under a topic model. This strategy has been adopted by a number of supervised topic models, such as MedLDA, which employs max-margin posterior constraints. However, unlike the likelihood-based supervised topic models, of which posterior inference can be carried out using the Bayes' rule, the max-margin posterior constraints have made Monte Carlo methods infeasible or at least not directly applicable, thereby limited the choice of inference algorithms to be based on variational approximation with strict mean field assumptions. In this paper, we develop two efficient Monte Carlo methods under much weaker assumptions for max-margin supervised topic models based on an importance sampler and a collapsed Gibbs sampler, respectively, in a convex dual formulation. We report thorough experimental results that compare our approach favorably against existing alternatives in both accuracy and efficiency."
1274,3994,2012,Matrix reconstruction with the local max norm,"We introduce a new family of matrix norms, the ''local max'' norms, generalizing existing methods such as the max norm, the trace norm (nuclear norm), and the weighted or smoothed weighted trace norms, which have been extensively used in the literature as regularizers for matrix reconstruction problems. We show that this new family can be used to interpolate between the (weighted or unweighted) trace norm and the more conservative max norm. We test this interpolation on simulated data and on the large-scale Netflix and MovieLens ratings data, and find improved accuracy relative to the existing matrix norms. We also provide theoretical results showing learning guarantees for some of the new norms."
1275,3995,2012,Bandit Algorithms boost Brain Computer Interfaces for motor-task selection of a brain-controlled button,"A brain-computer interface (BCI) allows users to ?communicate? with a computer without using their muscles. BCI based on sensori-motor rhythms use imaginary motor tasks, such as moving the right or left hand to send control signals. The performances of a BCI can vary greatly across users but also depend on the tasks used, making the problem of appropriate task selection an important issue. This study presents a new procedure to automatically select as fast as possible a discriminant motor task for a brain-controlled button. We develop for this purpose an adaptive algorithm UCB-classif based on the stochastic bandit theory. This shortens the training stage, thereby allowing the exploration of a greater variety of tasks. By not wasting time on inefficient tasks, and focusing on the most promising ones, this algorithm results in a faster task selection and a more efficient use of the BCI training session. Comparing the proposed method to the standard practice in task selection, for a fixed time budget, UCB-classif leads to an improve classification rate, and for a fix classification rate, to a reduction of the time spent in training by 50%."
1276,3996,2012,Graphical Models via Generalized Linear Models,"Undirected graphical models, or Markov networks, such as Gaussian graphical models and Ising models enjoy popularity in a variety of applications.  In many settings, however, data may not follow a Gaussian or binomial distribution assumed by these models. We introduce a new class of graphical models based on generalized linear models (GLM) by assuming that node-wise conditional distributions arise from exponential families.  Our models allow one to estimate networks for a wide class of exponential distributions, such as the Poisson, negative binomial, and exponential, by fitting penalized GLMs to select the neighborhood for each node. A major contribution of this paper is the rigorous statistical analysis showing that with high probability, the neighborhood of our graphical models can be recovered exactly. We provide examples of high-throughput genomic networks learned via our GLM graphical models for multinomial and Poisson distributed data."
1277,3997,2012,CPRL -- An Extension of Compressive Sensing to the Phase Retrieval Problem,"While compressive sensing (CS) has been one of the most vibrant and active research fields in the past few years, most development only applies to linear models. This limits its application and excludes many areas where CS ideas could make a difference. This paper presents a novel extension of CS to the phase retrieval problem, where intensity measurements of a linear system are used to recover a complex sparse signal. We propose a novel solution using a lifting technique -- CPRL, which relaxes the NP-hard problem to a nonsmooth semidefinite program. Our analysis shows that CPRL inherits many desirable properties from CS, such as guarantees for exact recovery. We further provide scalable numerical solvers to accelerate its implementation. The source code of our algorithms will be provided to the public."
1278,4000,2012,Learning Label Trees for Probabilistic Modelling of Implicit Feedback,"User preferences for items can be inferred from either explicit feedback, such as item ratings, or implicit feedback, such as rental histories. Research in collaborative filtering has concentrated on explicit feedback, resulting in the development of accurate and scalable models. However, since explicit feedback is often difficult to collect it is important to develop effective models that take advantage of the more widely available implicit feedback. We introduce a probabilistic approach to collaborative filtering with implicit feedback based on modelling the user's item selection process. In the interests of scalability, we restrict our attention to tree-structured distributions over items and develop a principled and efficient algorithm for learning item trees from data. We also identify a problem with a widely used protocol for evaluating implicit feedback models and propose a way of addressing it using a small quantity of explicit feedback data."
1279,4001,2012,Effective Split-Merge Monte Carlo Methods for Nonparametric Models of Sequential Data,"Applications of Bayesian nonparametric methods require learning and inference algorithms which efficiently explore models of unbounded complexity. We develop new Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for the beta process hidden Markov model (BP-HMM), enabling discovery of shared activity patterns in large video and motion capture databases. By introducing split-merge moves based on sequential allocation, we allow large global changes in the shared feature structure. We also develop data-driven reversible jump moves which more reliably discover rare or unique behaviors. Our proposals apply to any choice of conjugate likelihood for observed data, and we show success with multinomial, Gaussian, and autoregressive emission models. Together, these innovations allow tractable analysis of hundreds of time series, where previous inference required clever initialization and at least ten thousand burn-in iterations for just six sequences."
1280,4002,2012,Tensor Decomposition for Fast Parsing with Latent-Variable PCFGs,"We describe an approach to speed-up inference with latent variable PCFGs, which have been shown to  be highly effective for natural language parsing. Our approach is based on a tensor formulation recently introduced for spectral estimation of latent-variable PCFGs coupled with a tensor decomposition algorithm well-known in the multilinear algebra literature.  We also describe an error bound for this approximation, which bounds the difference between the probabilities calculated by the algorithm and the true probabilities that the approximated model gives. Empirical evaluation on real-world natural language parsing data demonstrates a significant speed-up at minimal cost for parsing performance."
1281,4003,2012,Locating Changes in Highly Dependent Data with Unknown Number of Change Points,"The problem of multiple change point estimation is  considered for sequences  with unknown number of change points.  A consistency framework is suggested that is suitable for highly dependent time-series, and an asymptotically consistent algorithm is proposed.   In order for the consistency to be established the only assumption  required is that the data is generated by stationary ergodic time-series distributions. No modeling, independence or parametric assumptions are made; the data are allowed to be dependent and the dependence can be of arbitrary form.  The theoretical results are complemented with experimental evaluations."
1282,4004,2012,Bayesian nonparametric models for ranked data,"We develop a Bayesian nonparametric extension of the popular Plackett-Luce choice model that can handle an infinite number of choice items.   Our framework is based on the theory of random atomic measures, with the prior specified by a gamma process.  We derive a posterior characterization and a simple and effective Gibbs sampler for posterior simulation.  We then develop a time-varying extension of our model, and apply our model to the New York Times lists of weekly bestselling books."
1283,4005,2012,Value Pursuit Iteration,"Value Pursuit Iteration (VPI) is an approximate value iteration algorithm that finds a close to optimal policy for  reinforcement learning and planning problems with large state spaces. VPI has two main features: First, it is a nonparametric algorithm that finds a good sparse approximation of the optimal value function given a dictionary of features. The algorithm is almost insensitive to the number of irrelevant features. Second, after each iteration of VPI, the algorithm adds a set of functions based on the currently learned value function to the dictionary. This increases the representation power of the dictionary in a way that is directly relevant to the goal of having a good approximation of the optimal value function. We theoretically study VPI and provide a finite-sample error upper bound for it."
1284,4006,2012,Exact and Stable Recovery of Sequences of Signals with Sparse Increments via Differential _1-Minimization,"We consider the problem of recovering a sequence of vectors, $(x_k)_{k=0}^K$, for which the increments $x_k-x_{k-1}$ are $S_k$-sparse (with $S_k$ typically smaller than $S_1$), based on linear measurements $(y_k = A_k x_k + e_k)_{k=1}^K$, where $A_k$ and $e_k$ denote the measurement matrix and noise, respectively. Assuming each $A_k$ obeys the restricted isometry property (RIP) of a certain order---depending only on $S_k$---we show that in the absence of noise a convex program, which minimizes the weighted sum of the $\ell_1$-norm of successive differences subject to the linear measurement constraints, recovers the sequence $(x_k)_{k=1}^K$ \emph{exactly}. This is an interesting result because this convex program is equivalent to a standard compressive sensing problem with a highly-structured aggregate measurement matrix which does not satisfy the RIP requirements in the standard sense, and yet we can achieve exact recovery. In the presence of bounded noise, we propose a quadratically-constrained convex program for recovery and derive bounds on the reconstruction error of the sequence. We supplement our theoretical analysis with simulations and an application to real video data. These further support the validity of the proposed approach for acquisition and recovery of signals with time-varying sparsity."
1285,4007,2012,Variational Inference for Crowdsourcing,"Crowdsourcing has become a popular paradigm for labeling large datasets. However, it has given rise to the computational task of aggregating the crowdsourced labels provided by a collection of unreliable annotators. We approach this problem by transforming it into a standard inference problem in graphical models, and applying approximate variational methods, including belief propagation (BP) and mean field (MF). We show that our BP algorithm generalizes both majority voting and a recent algorithm by Karger et al, while our MF method is closely related to a commonly used EM algorithm. In both cases, we find that the performance of the algorithms critically depends on the choice of a prior distribution on the workers' reliability; by choosing the prior properly, both BP and MF (and EM) perform surprisingly well on both simulated and real-world datasets, competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms based on more complicated modeling assumptions."
1286,4008,2012,Forward-Backward Activation Algorithm for Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models,"Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models (HHMMs) are sophisticated stochastic models that enable us to capture a hierarchical context characterization of sequence data. However, existing HHMM parameter estimation methods require large computations of time complexity O(TN^{2D}) at least for model inference, where D is the depth of the hierarchy, N is the number of states in each level, and T is the sequence length. In this paper, we propose a new inference method of HHMMs for which the time complexity is O(TN^{D+1}). A key idea of our algorithm is application of the forward-backward algorithm to ''state activation probabilities''. The notion of a state activation, which offers a simple formalization of the hierarchical transition behavior of HHMMs, enables us to conduct model inference efficiently. We present some experiments to demonstrate that our proposed method works more efficiently to estimate HHMM parameters than do some existing methods such as the flattening method and Gibbs sampling method."
1287,4009,2012,Distributed Probabilistic Learning for Camera Networks with Missing Data,"Probabilistic approaches to computer vision typically assume a centralized setting, with the algorithm granted access to all observed data points.  However, many problems in wide-area surveillance can benefit from distributed modeling, either because of physical or computational constraints.  Most distributed models to date use algebraic approaches (such as distributed SVD) and as a result cannot explicitly deal with missing data.  In this work we present an approach to estimation and learning of generative probabilistic models in a distributed context where certain sensor data can be missing.  In particular, we show how traditional centralized models, such as probabilistic PCA and missing-data PPCA, can be learned when the data is distributed across a network of sensors.  We demonstrate the utility of this approach on the problem of distributed affine structure from motion.  Our experiments suggest that the accuracy of the learned probabilistic structure and motion models rivals that of traditional centralized factorization methods while being able to handle challenging situations such as missing or noisy observations."
1288,4011,2012,Compressive Sensing MRI with Wavelet Tree Sparsity,"In Compressive Sensing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CS-MRI), one can reconstruct a MR image with good quality from only a small number of measurements. This can significantly reduce MR scanning time. According to structured sparsity theory, the measurements can be further reduced to $\mathcal{O}(K+\log n)$ for tree-sparse data instead of $\mathcal{O}(K+K\log n)$ for standard $K$-sparse data with length $n$. However, few of existing algorithms has utilized this for CS-MRI, while most of them use Total Variation and wavelet sparse regularization. On the other side, some algorithms have been proposed for tree sparsity regularization, but few of them has validated   the benefit of tree structure in CS-MRI. In this paper, we propose a fast convex optimization algorithm to improve CS-MRI.  Wavelet sparsity, gradient sparsity and tree sparsity are all considered in our model for real MR images. The original complex problem is decomposed to three simpler subproblems then each of the subproblems can be efficiently solved with an iterative scheme. Numerous experiments have been conducted and show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art CS-MRI algorithms, and gain better reconstructions results on real MR images than general tree based solvers or algorithms."
1289,4012,2012,On the connections between saliency and tracking,"A model connecting visual tracking and saliency has recently been proposed. This model is based on the saliency hypothesis for tracking which postulates that tracking is achieved by the top-down tuning, based on target features, of discriminant center-surround saliency mechanisms over time. In this work, we identify three main predictions that must hold if the hypothesis were true: 1) tracking reliability should be larger for salient than for non-salient targets, 2) tracking reliability should have a dependence on the defining variables of saliency, namely feature contrast and distractor heterogeneity, and must replicate the dependence of saliency on these variables, and 3) saliency and tracking can be implemented with common low level neural mechanisms. We confirm that the first two predictions hold by reporting results from a set of human behavior studies on the connection between saliency and tracking. We also show that the third prediction holds by constructing a common neurophysiologically plausible architecture that can computationally solve both saliency and tracking. This architecture is fully compliant with the standard physiological models of V1 and MT, and with what is known about attentional control in area LIP, while explaining the results of the human behavior experiments."
1290,4013,2012,Convex Multi-view Subspace Learning,"Subspace learning seeks a low dimensional representation of data that enables accurate reconstruction.  However, in many applications, data is obtained from multiple sources rather than a single source (e.g. an object might be viewed by cameras at different angles, or a document might consist of text and images).  The conditional independence of separate sources imposes constraints on their shared latent representation, which, if respected, can improve the quality of the learned low dimensional representation.  In this paper, we present a convex formulation of multi-view subspace learning that enforces conditional independence while reducing dimensionality.  For this formulation, we develop an efficient algorithm that recovers an optimal data reconstruction by exploiting an implicit convex regularizer, then recovers the corresponding latent representation and reconstruction model, jointly and optimally.  Experiments illustrate that the proposed method produces high quality results."
1291,4014,2012,A Stochastic Gradient Method with an Exponential Convergence _Rate for Finite Training Sets,"We propose a new stochastic gradient method for optimizing the sum of? a finite set of smooth functions, where the sum is strongly convex.? While standard stochastic gradient methods? converge at sublinear rates for this problem, the proposed method incorporates a memory of previous gradient values in order to achieve a linear convergence ?rate.  In a machine learning context, numerical experiments indicate that the new algorithm can dramatically outperform standard? algorithms, both in terms of optimizing the training error and reducing the test error quickly."
1292,4015,2012,Latent Coincidence Analysis: A Hidden Variable Model for Distance Metric Learning,"We describe a latent variable model for supervised dimensionality reduction and distance metric learning. The model discovers linear projections of high dimensional data that shrink the distance between similarly labeled inputs and expand the distance between differently labeled ones. The model?s continuous latent variables locate pairs of examples in a latent space of lower dimensionality. The model differs significantly from classical factor analysis in that the posterior distribution over these latent variables is not always multivariate Gaussian. Nevertheless we show that inference is completely tractable and derive an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation. We also compare the model to other approaches in distance metric learning. The model?s main advantage is its simplicity: at each iteration of the EM algorithm, the distance metric is re-estimated by solving an unconstrained least-squares problem. Experiments show that these simple updates are highly effective."
1293,4016,2012,Accuracy at the Top,"We introduce a new notion of classification accuracy based on the top $\tau$-quantile values of a scoring function, a relevant criterion in a number of problems arising for search engines. We define an algorithm optimizing a convex surrogate of the corresponding loss, and show how its solution can be obtained by solving several convex optimization problems. We also present margin-based guarantees for this algorithm based on the $\tau$-quantile of the functions in the hypothesis set. Finally, we report the results of several experiments evaluating the performance of our algorithm. In a comparison in a bipartite setting with several algorithms seeking high precision at the top, our algorithm achieves a better performance in precision at the top."
1294,4017,2012,Learning the Dependency Structure of Latent Factors,"In this paper, we study latent factor models with the dependency structure in the latent space.  We propose a general learning framework which induces sparsity on the undirected graphical model imposed on the vector of latent factors. A novel latent factor model SLFA is then proposed as a matrix factorization problem with a special regularization term that encourages collaborative reconstruction. The main benefit (novelty) of the model is that we can simultaneously learn the lower-dimensional representation for data and model the pairwise relationships between latent factors explicitly. An on-line learning algorithm is devised to make the model feasible for large-scale learning problems. Experimental results on two synthetic data and two real-world data sets demonstrate that pairwise relationships and latent factors learned by our model provide a more structured way of exploring high-dimensional data,  and the learned representations achieve the state-of-the-art classification performance."
1295,4018,2012,A Spectral Algorithm for Latent Dirichlet Allocation,"Topic modeling is a generalization of clustering that posits that observations (words in a document) are generated by \emph{multiple} latent factors (topics), as opposed to just one. This increased representational power comes at the cost of a more challenging unsupervised learning problem of estimating the topic-word distributions when only words are observed, and the topics are hidden.  This work provides a simple and efficient learning procedure that is guaranteed to recover the parameters for a wide class of topic models, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). For LDA, the procedure correctly recovers both the topic-word distributions and the parameters of the Dirichlet prior over the topic mixtures, using only trigram statistics (\emph{i.e.}, third order moments, which may be estimated with documents containing just three words). The method, called Excess Correlation Analysis, is based on a spectral decomposition of low-order moments via two singular value decompositions (SVDs). Moreover, the algorithm is scalable, since the SVDs are carried out only on $k \times k$ matrices, where $k$ is the number of latent factors (topics) and is typically much smaller than the dimension of the observation (word) space."
1296,4019,2012,Relax and Randomize : From Value to Algorithms,"We show a principled way of deriving online learning algorithms from a minimax analysis. Various upper bounds on the minimax value, previously thought to be non-constructive, are shown to yield algorithms. This allows us to seamlessly recover known methods and to derive new ones, also capturing such ''unorthodox'' methods as Follow the Perturbed Leader and the R^2 forecaster. Understanding the inherent complexity of the learning problem thus leads to the development of algorithms. To illustrate our approach, we present several new algorithms, including a family of randomized methods that use the idea of a ''random play out''. New versions of the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader algorithms are presented, as well as methods based on the Littlestone's dimension, efficient methods for matrix completion with trace norm, and algorithms for the problems of transductive learning and prediction with static experts."
1297,4020,2012,Learning curves for multi-task Gaussian process regression,"We study the average case performance of multi-task Gaussian process (GP)   regression as captured in the learning curve, i.e.\ the average Bayes error   for a chosen task versus the total number of examples $n$ for all   tasks. For GP covariances that are the product of an   input-dependent covariance function and a free-form inter-task   covariance matrix, we   show that accurate approximations for the learning curve can be   obtained for an arbitrary number of tasks $T$.  We use   these to study the asymptotic learning behaviour for large   $n$. Surprisingly, multi-task learning can be asymptotically essentially   useless: examples from other tasks only help when the   degree of inter-task correlation, $\rho$, is near its maximal value   $\rho=1$. This effect is most extreme for learning of smooth target   functions as described by e.g.\ squared exponential kernels. We also   demonstrate that when learning {\em many} tasks, the learning curves   separate into an initial phase, where the Bayes error on each task   is reduced down to a plateau value by ``collective learning''    even though most tasks have not seen examples,   and a final decay that occurs only once the number of examples is   proportional to the number of tasks."
1298,4022,2012,Best Arm Identification: A Unified Approach to Fixed Budget and Fixed Confidence,"We study the problem of identifying the best arm(s) in the stochastic multi-armed bandit setting. This problem has been studied in the literature from two different perspectives: fixed budget and fixed confidence. We propose a unifying approach that leads to a meta-algorithm called unified gap-based exploration (UGapE), with a common structure and similar theoretical analysis for these two settings. We prove a performance bound for the two versions of the algorithm showing that the two problems are characterized by the same notion of complexity. We also show how the UGapE algorithm as well as its theoretical analysis can be extended to take into account the variance of the arms and to multiple bandits. Finally, we evaluate the performance of UGapE and compare it with a number of existing fixed budget and fixed confidence algorithms."
1299,4023,2012,Density-Difference Estimation,"We address the problem of estimating the difference between two probability densities. A naive approach  is a two-step procedure of first estimating two densities separately and then computing their difference. However, such a two-step procedure does not necessarily work well because the first step is performed without regard to the second step and thus a small estimation error incurred in the first stage can cause a big error in the second stage. In this paper, we propose a single-shot procedure  for directly estimating the density difference without separately estimating two densities. We derive a non-parametric finite-sample error bound for the proposed single-shot density-difference estimator and show that it achieves the optimal convergence rate. We then show how the proposed density-difference estimator can be utilized in L2-distance approximation. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method in robust distribution comparison such as class-prior estimation and change-point detection."
1300,4024,2012,Exploration in Model-based Reinforcement Learning by Empirically Estimating Learning Progress,"Formal exploration approaches in model-based reinforcement learning estimate the accuracy of the currently learned model without consideration of the empirical prediction error. For example, PAC-MDP approaches such as Rmax base their model certainty on the amount of collected data, while Bayesian approaches assume a prior over the transition dynamics. We propose extensions to such approaches which drive exploration solely based on empirical estimates of the learner's accuracy and learning progress. We provide a ``sanity check'' theoretical analysis, discussing the behavior of our extensions in the standard stationary finite state-action case. We then provide experimental studies demonstrating the robustness of these exploration measures in cases of non-stationary environments or where original approaches are misled by wrong domain assumptions."
1301,4025,2012,Minimax Multi-Task Learning and a Generalized Loss-Compositional Paradigm for MTL,"Since its inception, the modus operandi of multi-task learning (MTL) has been to minimize the task-wise mean of the empirical risks.   We introduce a generalized loss-compositional paradigm for MTL that includes a spectrum of formulations as a subfamily. One endpoint of this spectrum is minimax MTL: a new MTL formulation that minimizes the maximum of the tasks' empirical risks. Via a certain relaxation of minimax MTL, we obtain a continuum of MTL formulations spanning minimax MTL and classical MTL. The full paradigm itself is loss-compositional, operating on the vector of empirical risks. It incorporates minimax MTL, its relaxations, and many new MTL formulations as special cases. We show theoretically that minimax MTL tends to avoid worst case outcomes on newly drawn test tasks in the learning to learn (LTL) test setting. The results of several MTL formulations on synthetic and real problems in the MTL and LTL test settings are encouraging."
1302,4026,2012,Minimization of Continuous Bethe Approximations: A Positive Variation,"We develop convergent minimization algorithms for Bethe variational approximations which explicitly constrain marginal estimates to families of valid distributions.  While existing message passing algorithms define fixed point iterations corresponding to stationary points of the Bethe free energy, their greedy dynamics do not distinguish between local minima and maxima, and can fail to converge. For continuous estimation problems, this instability is linked to the creation of invalid marginal estimates, such as Gaussians with negative variance. Conversely, our approach leverages multiplier methods with well-understood convergence properties, and uses bound projection methods to ensure that marginal approximations are valid at all iterations. We derive general algorithms for discrete and Gaussian pairwise Markov random fields, showing improvements over standard loopy belief propagation. We also apply our method to a hybrid model with both discrete and continuous variables, showing improvements over expectation propagation."
1303,4027,2012,Stochastic optimization and sparse statistical recovery: Optimal algorithms for high dimensions,"We develop and analyze stochastic optimization algorithms for problems in which the expected loss is strongly convex, and the optimum is (approximately) sparse. Previous approaches are able to exploit only one of these two structures, yielding a $\order(\pdim/T)$ convergence rate for strongly convex objectives in $\pdim$ dimensions and $\order(\sqrt{\spindex( \log\pdim)/T})$ convergence rate when the optimum is $\spindex$-sparse. Our algorithm is based on successively solving a series of $\ell_1$-regularized optimization problems using Nesterov's dual averaging algorithm. We establish that the error of our solution after $T$ iterations is at most $\order(\spindex(\log\pdim)/T)$, with natural extensions to approximate sparsity. Our results apply to locally Lipschitz losses including the logistic, exponential, hinge and least-squares losses. By recourse to statistical minimax results, we show that our convergence rates are optimal up to constants. The effectiveness of our approach is also confirmed in numerical simulations where we compare to several baselines on a least-squares regression problem."
1304,4029,2012,GenDeR: A Generic Diversified Ranking Algorithm,"Diversified ranking is a fundamental task in machine learning. It is broadly applicable in many real world problems, e.g., information retrieval, team assembling, product search, etc. In this paper, we consider a generic setting where we aim to diversify the top-k ranking list based on an arbitrary relevance function and an arbitrary similarity function among all the examples. We formulate it as an optimization problem and show that in general it is NP-hard. Then, we show that for a large volume of the parameter space, the proposed objective function enjoys the diminishing returns property, which enables us to design a scalable, greedy algorithm to find the near-optimal solution. Experimental results on real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."
1305,4030,2012,Entangled Monte Carlo,"We propose a novel method for scalable parallelization of SMC algorithms, Entangled Monte Carlo simulation (EMC).  EMC avoids the transmission of particles between  nodes, and instead reconstructs them from the particle genealogy. In particular, we show that we can reduce the communication to the particle weights for each machine while efficiently maintaining implicit global coherence of the parallel simulation. We explain methods to efficiently maintain a genealogy of particles from which any particle can be reconstructed. We demonstrate using examples from Bayesian phylogenetic that the computational gain from parallelization using EMC significantly outweighs the cost of particle reconstruction. The timing experiments show that reconstruction of particles is indeed much more efficient as compared to transmission of particles."
1306,4031,2012,The Bethe Partition Function of Log-supermodular Graphical Models,"Sudderth, Wainwright, and Willsky conjectured that the Bethe approximation corresponding to any fixed point of the belief propagation algorithm over an attractive, pairwise binary graphical model provides a lower bound on the true partition function. In this work, we resolve this conjecture in the affirmative by demonstrating that, for any graphical model with binary variables whose potential functions (not necessarily pairwise) are all log-supermodular, the Bethe partition function always lower bounds the true partition function.  The proof of this result follows from a new variant of the ?four functions? theorem that may be of independent interest."
1307,4033,2012,Nonparanormal Belief Propagation (NPNBP),"The empirical success of the belief propagation approximate inference algorithm has inspired numerous theoretical and algorithmic advances. Yet, for continuous non-Gaussian domains performing belief propagation remains a challenging task: recent innovations such as nonparametric or kernel belief propagation, while useful, come with a substantial computational cost and offer little theoretical guarantees, even for tree structured models.  In this work we present Nonparanormal BP  for performing efficient inference on distributions parameterized by  a Gaussian copulas network and any univariate marginals. For  tree structured networks, our approach is guaranteed to be exact for  this powerful class of non-Gaussian models. Importantly, the method  is as efficient as standard Gaussian BP, and its convergence properties do not depend on the complexity of the univariate marginals, even when a nonparametric representation is used."
1308,4034,2012,Learning Probability Measures with respect to Optimal Transport Metrics,"We study the problem of estimating, in the sense of optimal transport metrics, a measure which is assumed supported on a manifold embedded in a Hilbert space. By establishing a precise connection between optimal transport metrics, optimal quantization, and learning theory, we derive new probabilistic bounds for the performance of a classic algorithm in unsupervised learning (k-means), when used to produce a probability measure derived from the data. In the course of the analysis, we arrive at new lower bounds, as well as probabilistic bounds on the convergence rate of the empirical law of large numbers, which, unlike existing bounds, are applicable to a wide class of measures."
1309,4035,2012,Continuous Relaxations for Discrete Hamiltonian Monte Carlo,"Continuous relaxations play an important role in discrete optimization, but have not seen much use in approximate probabilistic inference. Here we show that a general form of the Gaussian Integral Trick makes it possible to transform a wide class of discrete variable undirected models into fully continuous systems. The continuous representation allows the use of gradient-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for inference,  results in new ways of estimating normalization constants (partition functions), and in general opens up a number of new avenues for inference in difficult discrete systems. We demonstrate some of these continuous relaxation inference algorithms on a number of illustrative problems."
1310,4036,2012,Multiple Operator-valued Kernel Learning,"Positive definite operator-valued kernels generalize the well-known notion of reproducing kernels, and are naturally adapted to multi-output learning situations. This paper addresses the problem of learning a finite linear combination of infinite-dimensional operator-valued kernels which are suitable for extending functional data analysis methods to nonlinear contexts. We study this problem in the case of kernel ridge regression for functional responses with an lr-norm constraint on the combination coefficients. The resulting optimization problem is more involved than those of multiple scalar-valued kernel learning since operator-valued kernels pose more technical and theoretical issues. We propose a multiple operator-valued kernel learning algorithm based on solving a system of linear operator equations by using a block coordinate-descent procedure. We experimentally validate our approach on a functional regression task in the context of finger movement prediction in brain-computer interfaces."
1311,4037,2012,Augmented-SVM: Automatic space partitioning for combining multiple non-linear dynamics,"Non-linear dynamical systems (DS) have been used extensively for building generative models of human behavior. Its applications range from modeling brain dynamics  to encoding motor commands. Many schemes have been proposed for encoding robot motions using dynamical systems with a single attractor placed at a predefined target in state space. Although these enable the robots to react against sudden perturbations without any re-planning, the motions are always directed towards a single target. In this work, we focus on combining several such DS with distinct attractors, resulting in a multi-stable DS. We show its applicability in reach-to-grasp tasks where the attractors represent several grasping points on the target object. While exploiting multiple attractors provides more flexibility in recovering from unseen perturbations, it also increases the complexity of the underlying learning problem. Here we present the Augmented-SVM (A-SVM) model which inherits region partitioning ability of the well known SVM classifier and is augmented with novel constraints derived from the individual DS. The new constraints modify the original SVM dual whose optimal solution then results in a new class of support vectors (SV). These new SV ensure that the resulting multi-stable DS incurs minimum deviation from the original dynamics and is stable at each of the attractors within a finite region of attraction. We show, via implementations on a simulated 10 degrees of freedom mobile robotic platform, that the model is capable of real-time motion generation and is able to adapt on-the-fly to perturbations."
1312,4038,2012,Identifiability and Unmixing of Latent Parse Trees,"This paper explores unsupervised learning of parsing models along two directions.  First, which models are identifiable from infinite data?  We use a general technique for numerically checking identifiability based on the rank of a Jacobian matrix, and apply it to several standard constituency and dependency parsing models.  Second, for identifiable models, how do we estimate the parameters efficiently?  EM suffers from local optima, while recent work using spectral methods cannot be directly applied since the topology of the parse tree varies across sentences.  We develop a strategy, unmixing, which deals with this additional complexity for restricted classes of parsing models."
1313,4039,2012,Recognizing Activities by Attribute Dynamics,"In this work, we consider the problem of modeling the dynamic structure of human activities in  the attributes space. A video sequence is first represented in a semantic feature space, where each feature encodes the probability of  occurrence of an activity attribute at a given time. A generative model,  denoted the binary dynamic system (BDS), is proposed to learn both the distribution and dynamics of different activities in this  space. The BDS is a non-linear dynamic system, which extends both the binary  principal component analysis (PCA) and classical linear dynamic systems (LDS), by combining binary observation variables with a hidden Gauss-Markov state  process. In this way, it integrates the representation power of semantic  modeling with the ability of dynamic systems to capture the temporal structure of time-varying processes. An algorithm for learning BDS  parameters, inspired by a popular LDS  learning method from dynamic textures, is proposed. A similarity measure between BDSs, which generalizes  the Binet-Cauchy kernel for LDS, is then introduced and used to design  activity classifiers. The proposed method is shown to outperform similar classifiers  derived from the kernel dynamic system (KDS) and state-of-the-art approaches for  dynamics-based or attribute-based action recognition."
1314,4040,2012,Active Learning of Model Evidence Using Bayesian Quadrature,"Numerical integration is an key component of many problems in scientific computing, statistical modelling, and machine learning. Bayesian Quadrature is a model-based method for numerical integration which, relative to standard Monte Carlo methods, offers increased sample efficiency and a more robust estimate of the uncertainty in the estimated integral. We propose a novel Bayesian Quadrature approach for numerical integration when the integrand is non-negative, such as the case of computing the marginal likelihood, predictive distribution, or normalising constant of a probabilistic model. Our approach approximately marginalises the quadrature model's hyperparameters in closed form, and introduces an active learning scheme to optimally select function evaluations, as opposed to using Monte Carlo samples. We demonstrate our method on both a number of synthetic benchmarks and a real scientific problem from astronomy."
1315,4042,2012,Topic-Partitioned Multinetwork Embeddings,"We introduce a joint model of network content and context designed for exploratory analysis of email networks via visualization of topic-specific communication patterns. Our model is an admixture model for text and network attributes which uses multinomial distributions over words as mixture components for explaining text and latent Euclidean positions of actors as mixture components for explaining network attributes.  We validate the appropriateness of our model by achieving state-of-the-art performance on a link prediction task and by achieving semantic coherence equivalent to that of latent Dirichlet allocation. We demonstrate the capability of our model for descriptive, explanatory, and exploratory analysis by investigating the inferred topic-specific communication patterns of a new government email dataset, the New Hanover County email corpus."
1316,4044,2012,Priors for Diversity in Generative Latent Variable Models,"Probabilistic latent variable models are one of the cornerstones of machine learning.  They offer a convenient and coherent way to specify prior distributions over unobserved structure in data, so that these unknown properties can be inferred via posterior inference.  Such models are useful for exploratory analysis and visualization, for building density models of data, and for   providing features that can be used for later discriminative tasks. A significant limitation of these models, however, is that draws from the prior are often highly redundant due to i.i.d. assumptions   on internal parameters.  For example, there is no preference in the prior of a mixture model to make components non-overlapping, or in topic model to ensure that co-ocurring words only appear in a small number of topics.  In this work, we revisit these independence assumptions for probabilistic latent variable models, replacing the   underlying i.i.d.\ prior with a determinantal point process (DPP). The DPP allows us to specify a preference for diversity in our latent variables using a positive definite kernel function.  Using a kernel between probability distributions, we are able to define a DPP on probability measures.  We show how to perform MAP inference   with DPP priors in latent Dirichlet allocation and in mixture models, leading to better intuition for the latent variable representation and quantitatively improved unsupervised feature extraction, without compromising the generative aspects of the model."
1317,4045,2012,Unsupervised Structure Discovery for Semantic Analysis of Audio,"Approaches to audio classification and retrieval tasks largely rely on detection-based discriminative models. We submit that such models make a simplistic assumption in mapping acoustics directly to semantics, whereas the actual process is likely more complex. We present a generative model that maps acoustics in a hierarchical manner to increasingly higher-level semantics. Our model has 2 layers with the first being generic sound units with no clear semantic associations, while the second layer attempts to find patterns over the generic sound units. We evaluate our model on a large-scale retrieval task from TRECVID 2011, and report significant improvements over standard baselines."
1318,4046,2012,Learning Partially Observable Models Using Temporally Abstract Decision Trees,"This paper introduces timeline trees, which are partial models of partially observable environments. Timeline trees are given some specific predictions to make and learn a decision tree over history. The main idea of timeline trees is to use temporally abstract features to identify and split on features of key events, spread arbitrarily far apart in the past (whereas previous decision-tree-based methods have been limited to a finite suffix of history). Experiments demonstrate that timeline trees can learn to make high quality predictions in complex, partially observable environments with high-dimensional observations (e.g. an arcade game)."
1319,4047,2012,Accelerated Training for Matrix-norm Regularization: A Boosting Approach,"Sparse learning models typically combine a smooth loss with a nonsmooth penalty, such as trace norm. Although recent developments in sparse approximation have offered promising solution methods, current approaches either apply only to matrix-norm constrained problems or provide suboptimal convergence rates. In this paper, we propose a boosting method for regularized learning that guarantees $\epsilon$ accuracy within $O(1/\epsilon)$ iterations. Performance is further accelerated by interlacing boosting with fixed-rank local optimization---exploiting a simpler local objective than previous work. The proposed method yields state-of-the-art performance on large-scale problems. We also demonstrate an application to latent multiview learning for which we provide the first efficient weak-oracle."
1320,4048,2012,Mirror Descent Meets Fixed Share (and feels no regret),"Mirror descent with an entropic regularizer is known to achieve shifting regret bounds that are logarithmic in the dimension. This is done using either a carefully designed projection or by a weight sharing technique. Via a novel unified analysis, we show that these two approaches deliver essentially equivalent bounds on a notion of regret generalizing shifting, adaptive, discounted, and other related regrets. Our analysis also captures and extends the generalized weight sharing technique of Bousquet and Warmuth, and can be refined in several ways, including improvements for small losses and adaptive tuning of parameters."
1321,4049,2012,Statistical Consistency of Ranking Methods in A Rank-Differentiable Probability Space,"This paper is concerned with the statistical consistency of ranking methods. Recently, it was proven that many commonly used pairwise ranking methods are inconsistent with the weighted pairwise disagreement loss (WPDL), which can be viewed as the true loss of ranking, even in a low-noise setting. This result is interesting but also surprising, given that the pairwise ranking methods have been shown very effective in practice. In this paper, we argue that the aforementioned result might not be conclusive, depending on what kind of assumptions are used. We give a new assumption that the labels of objects to rank lie in a rank-differentiable probability space (RDPS), and prove that the pairwise ranking methods become consistent with WPDL under this assumption. What is especially inspiring is that RDPS is actually not stronger than but similar to the low-noise setting. Our studies provide theoretical justifications of some empirical findings on pairwise ranking methods that are unexplained before, which bridge the gap between theory and applications."
1322,4050,2012,Online Regret Bounds for Undiscounted Continuous Reinforcement Learning,"We derive sublinear regret bounds for undiscounted reinforcement learning in continuous state space. The proposed algorithm combines state aggregation with the use of upper confidence bounds for implementing optimism in the face of uncertainty.  Beside the existence of an optimal policy which satisfies the Poisson equation, the only assumptions made are Hoelder continuity of rewards and transition probabilities."
1323,4051,2012,Entropy Estimations Using Correlated Symmetric Stable Random Projections,"Methods for efficiently estimating the Shannon entropy of data streams have important applications in learning, data mining, and network anomaly detections (e.g., the DDoS attacks). For nonnegative data streams, the method of Compressed Counting (CC) based on maximally-skewed stable random projections can provide accurate estimates of the Shannon entropy using small storage. However, CC is no longer applicable when entries of data streams can be below zero, which is a common scenario when comparing two streams. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for entropy estimation in general data streams which allow negative entries. In our method, the Shannon entropy is approximated by the finite difference of two correlated frequency moments estimated from correlated samples of symmetric stable random variables. Our experiments confirm that this method is able to substantially better approximate the Shannon entropy compared to the prior state-of-the-art."
1324,4052,2012,Cardinality Restricted Boltzmann Machines,"The Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a popular density model that is also good for extracting features. A main source of tractability in RBM models is the model's assumption that given an input, hidden units activate independently from one another. Sparsity and competition in the hidden representation is believed to be beneficial, and while an RBM with competition among its hidden units would acquire some of the attractive properties of sparse coding, such constraints are not added  due to the widespread belief that the resulting model would become intractable.  In this work, we show how a dynamic programming algorithm developed in 1981 can be used to implement exact sparsity in the RBM's hidden units. We then expand on this and show how to pass derivatives through a layer of exact sparsity, which makes it possible to fine-tune a deep belief network (DBN) consisting of RBMs with sparse hidden layers.  We show that sparsity in the RBM's hidden layer improves the performance of both the pre-trained representations and of the fine-tuned model."
1325,4053,2012,Probabilistic Low-Rank Subspace Clustering,"In this paper, we consider the problem of clustering data points into low-dimensional subspaces in the presence of outliers. We pose the problem using a density estimation formulation with an associated generative model. Based on this probability model, we first develop an iterative expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and then derive its global solution. In addition, we develop two Bayesian methods based on variational Bayesian (VB) approximation, which are capable of automatic dimensionality selection. While the first method is based on an alternating optimization scheme for all unknowns, the second method makes use of recent results in VB matrix factorization leading to fast and effective estimation. Both methods are extended to handle sparse outliers for robustness and can handle missing values. Experimental results suggest that proposed methods are very effective in clustering and identifying outliers."
1326,4055,2012,Rational inference of relative preferences,"Statistical decision theory axiomatically assumes that the relative desirability of different options that humans perceive is well described by assigning them option-specific scalar utility functions. However, this assumption is refuted by observed human behavior, including studies wherein preferences have been shown to change systematically simply through variation in the set of choice options presented. In this paper, we show that interpreting desirability as a relative comparison between available options at any particular decision instance results in a rational theory of value-inference that explains heretofore intractable violations of rational choice behavior in human subjects. Complementarily, we also characterize the conditions under which a rational agent selecting optimal options indicated by dynamic value inference in our framework will behave identically to one whose preferences are encoded using a static ordinal utility function."
1327,4056,2012,Bayesian Probabilistic Co-Subspace Addition,"For modeling data matrices, this paper introduces Probabilistic Co-Subspace Addition (PCSA) model by simultaneously capturing the dependent structures among both rows and columns. Briefly, PCSA assumes that each entry of a matrix is generated by the additive combination of the linear mappings of two features, which distribute in the row-wise and column-wise latent subspaces. Consequently, it captures the dependencies among entries intricately, and is able to model the non-Gaussian and heteroscedastic density. Variational inference is proposed on PCSA for  approximate Bayesian learning, where the updating for posteriors is formulated into the problem of solving Sylvester equations. Furthermore, PCSA is extended to tackling and filling missing values, to adapting its sparseness, and to modelling tensor data. In comparison with several state-of-art approaches, experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Bayesian (sparse) PCSA on modeling matrix (tensor) data and filling missing values."
1328,4057,2012,Context-Sensitive Decision Forests for Object Detection,"In this paper we introduce Context-Sensitive Decision Forests - A new perspective to exploit contextual information in the popular decision forest framework for the object detection problem. They are tree-structured classifiers with the ability to access intermediate prediction (here: classification and regression) information during training and inference time. This intermediate prediction is available to each sample, which allows us to develop context-based decision criteria, used for refining the prediction process. In addition, we introduce a novel split criterion which in combination with a priority based way of constructing the trees, allows more accurate regression mode selection and hence improves the current context information. In our experiments, we demonstrate improved results for the task of pedestrian detection on the challenging TUD data set when compared to state-of-the-art methods."
1329,4058,2012,Ancestor Sampling for Particle Gibbs,"We present a novel method in the family of particle MCMC methods that we refer to as particle Gibbs with ancestor sampling (PG-AS). Similarly to the existing PG with backward simulation (PG-BS) procedure, we use backward sampling to (considerably) improve the mixing of the PG kernel. Instead of using separate forward and backward sweeps as in PG-BS, however, we achieve the same effect in a single forward sweep. We apply the PG-AS framework to the challenging class of non-Markovian state-space models. We develop a truncation strategy of these models that is applicable in principle to any backward-simulation-based method, but which is particularly well suited to the PG-AS framework. In particular, as we show in a simulation study, PG-AS can yield an order-of-magnitude improved accuracy relative to PG-BS due to its robustness to the truncation error. Several application examples are discussed, including Rao-Blackwellized particle smoothing and inference in degenerate state-space models."
1330,4059,2012,Feature Clustering for Accelerating Parallel Coordinate Descent,"Large scale $\ell_1$-regularized loss minimization problems arise in numerous applications such as compressed sensing and high dimensional supervised learning, including classification and regression problems.  High performance algorithms and implementations are critical to efficiently solving these problems.  Building upon previous work on coordinate descent algorithms for $\ell_1$ regularized problems, we introduce a novel family of algorithms called block-greedy coordinate descent that includes, as special cases, several existing algorithms such as SCD, Greedy CD, Shotgun, and Thread-greedy.  We give a unified convergence analysis for the family of block-greedy algorithms.  The analysis suggests that block-greedy coordinate descent can better exploit parallelism if features are clustered so that the maximum inner product between features in different blocks is small.  Our theoretical convergence analysis is supported with experimental results using data from diverse real-world applications.  We hope that algorithmic approaches and convergence analysis we provide will not only advance the field, but will also encourage researchers to systematically explore the design space of algorithms for solving large-scale $\ell_1$-regularization problems."
1331,4060,2012,Perfect Dimensionality Recovery by Variational Bayesian PCA,"The variational Bayesian (VB) approach is one of the best tractable approximations to the Bayesian estimation, and it was demonstrated to perform well in many applications. However, its good performance was not fully understood theoretically. For example, VB sometimes produces a sparse solution, which is regarded as a practical advantage of VB, but such sparsity is hardly observed in the rigorous Bayesian estimation. In this paper, we focus on probabilistic PCA and give more theoretical insight into the empirical success of VB. More specifically, for the situation where the noise variance is unknown, we derive a sufficient condition for perfect recovery of the true PCA dimensionality in the large-scale limit when the size of an observed matrix goes to infinity. In our analysis, we obtain bounds for a noise variance estimator and simple closed-form solutions for other parameters, which themselves are actually very useful for better implementation of VB-PCA."
1332,4061,2012,Confusion-Based Online Learning and a Passive-Aggressive Scheme,"This paper provides the first ---to the best of our knowledge--- analysis of online learning algorithms for multiclass problems when the {\em confusion} matrix is taken as a performance measure. The work builds upon recent and elegant results on noncommutative concentration inequalities, i.e. concentration inequalities that apply to matrices, and more precisely to matrix martingales.  We do establish generalization bounds for online learning algorithm and show how the theoretical study motivate the proposition of a new confusion-friendly learning procedure. This learning algorithm, called \copa (for COnfusion Passive-Aggressive) is a passive-aggressive learning algorithm; it is shown that the update equations for \copa can be computed analytically, thus allowing the user from having to recours to any optimization package to implement it."
1333,4062,2012,Augment-and-Conquer Negative Binomial Processes,"By developing data augmentation methods unique to the negative binomial (NB) distribution, we unite seemingly disjoint count and mixture models  under the  NB process framework. We develop fundamental properties of the models and derive efficient Gibbs sampling inference. We show that the  gamma-NB process can be reduced to the hierarchical Dirichlet process with normalization, highlighting its unique theoretical, structural and computational advantages. A variety of NB processes with distinct sharing mechanisms are constructed and applied to topic modeling, with connections to existing algorithms, showing the importance of inferring both the NB dispersion and probability parameters."
1334,4063,2012,Multiclass Learning Approaches: A Theoretical Comparison with Implications,"We theoretically analyze and compare the following five popular multiclass classification methods: One vs. All, All Pairs, Tree-based classifiers, Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) with randomly generated code matrices, and Multiclass SVM. In the first four methods, the classification is based on a reduction to binary classification. We consider the case where the binary classifier comes from a class of VC dimension $d$, and in particular from the class of halfspaces over $\reals^d$. We analyze both the estimation error and the approximation error of these methods. Our analysis reveals interesting conclusions of practical relevance, regarding the success of the different approaches under various conditions. Our proof technique employs tools from VC theory to analyze the \emph{approximation error} of hypothesis classes. This is in sharp contrast to most, if not all, previous uses of VC theory, which only deal with estimation error."
1335,4064,2012,Efficient Reinforcement Learning for High Dimensional Linear Quadratic Systems,"We study the problem of adaptive control of a high dimensional linear quadratic (LQ) system.  Previous work established the asymptotic convergence to an optimal controller for various adaptive control schemes. More recently, an asymptotic regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ was shown for $T \gg p$ where $p$ is the dimension of the state space. In this work we consider the case where the matrices describing the dynamic of the LQ system are sparse and their dimensions are large. We present an adaptive control scheme that for $p \gg 1$ and $T \gg \polylog(p)$ achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(p \sqrt{T})$. In particular, our algorithm has an average cost of $(1+\eps)$ times the optimum cost after $T = \polylog(p) O(1/\eps^2)$. This is in comparison to previous work on the dense dynamics where the algorithm needs $\Omega(p)$ samples before it can estimate the unknown dynamic with any significant accuracy. We believe our result has prominent applications in the emerging area of computational advertising, in particular targeted online advertising and advertising in social networks."
1336,4066,2012,Analyzing 3D Objects in Cluttered Images,"We present an approach to detecting and analyzing the 3D configuration of objects in real-world images with heavy occlusion and clutter. We focus on the application of finding and analyzing cars. We do so with a two-stage model; the first stage reasons about 2D shape and appearance variation due to within-class variation(station wagons look different than sedans) and changes in viewpoint. Rather than using a view-based model, we describe a compositional representation that models a large number of effective views and shapes using a small number of local view-based templates. We use this model to propose candidate detections and 2D estimates of shape. These estimates are then refined by our second stage, using an explicit 3D model of shape and viewpoint. We use a morphable model to capture 3D within-class variation, and use a weak-perspective camera model to capture viewpoint. We learn all model parameters from 2D annotations. We demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy for detection, viewpoint estimation, and 3D shape reconstruction on challenging images from the PASCAL VOC 2011 dataset."
1337,4067,2012,A mechanistic model of early sensory processing based on subtracting sparse representations,"Early stages of sensory systems face the challenge of compressing information from numerous receptors onto a much smaller number of projection neurons, a so called communication bottleneck. To make more efficient use of limited bandwidth, compression may be achieved using predictive coding, whereby predictable, or redundant, components of the stimulus are removed. In the case of the retina, Srinivasan et al. (1982) suggested that feedforward inhibitory connections subtracting a linear prediction generated from nearby receptors implement such compression, resulting in biphasic center-surround receptive fields. However, feedback inhibitory circuits are common in early sensory circuits and furthermore their dynamics may be nonlinear. Can such circuits implement predictive coding as well? Here, solving the transient dynamics of nonlinear reciprocal feedback circuits through analogy to a signal-processing algorithm called linearized Bregman iteration we show that nonlinear predictive coding can be implemented in an inhibitory feedback circuit. In response to a step stimulus, interneuron activity in time constructs progressively less sparse but more accurate representations of the stimulus, a temporally evolving prediction. This analysis provides a powerful theoretical framework to interpret and understand the dynamics of early sensory processing in a variety of physiological experiments and yields novel predictions regarding the relation between activity and stimulus statistics."
1338,4068,2012,Multiresolution Gaussian Processes,"We propose a multiresolution Gaussian process to capture long-range, non-Markovian dependencies while allowing for abrupt changes.  The multiresolution GP hierarchically couples a collection of smooth GPs, each defined over an element of a random nested partition.  Long-range dependencies are captured by the top-level GP while the partition points define the abrupt changes.  Due to the inherent conjugacy of the GPs, one can analytically marginalize the GPs and compute the conditional likelihood of the observations given the partition tree.  This allows for efficient inference of the partition itself, for which we employ graph-theoretic techniques.  We apply the multiresolution GP to the analysis of Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of brain activity."
1339,4069,2012,Multimodal Learning with Deep Boltzmann Machines,"We propose a Deep Boltzmann Machine for learning a generative model of multimodal data. We show how to use the model to extract a meaningful representation of multimodal data. We find that the learned representation is useful for classification and information retreival tasks, and hence conforms to some notion of semantic similarity. The model defines a probability density over the space of multimodal inputs. By sampling from the conditional distributions over each data modality, it possible to create the representation even when some data modalities are missing. Our experimental results on bi-modal data consisting of images and text show that the Multimodal DBM can learn a good generative model of the joint space of image and text inputs that is useful for information retrieval from both unimodal and multimodal queries. We further demonstrate that our model can significantly outperform SVMs and LDA on discriminative tasks. Finally, we compare our model to other deep learning methods, including autoencoders and deep belief networks, and show that it achieves significant gains."
1340,4070,2012,Generalization Bounds for Domain Adaptation,"In this paper, we provide a new framework to study the generalization bound of the learning process for domain adaptation. Without loss of generality, we consider two kinds of representative domain adaptation settings: one is domain adaptation with multiple sources and the other is domain adaptation combining source and target data. In particular, we introduce two quantities that capture the inherent characteristics of domains. For either kind of domain adaptation, based on the two quantities, we then develop the specific Hoeffding-type deviation inequality and symmetrization inequality to achieve the corresponding generalization bound based on the uniform entropy number. By using the resultant generalization bound, we analyze the asymptotic convergence and the rate of convergence of the learning process for such kind of domain adaptation. Meanwhile, we discuss the factors that affect the asymptotic behavior of the learning process. The numerical experiments support our results."
1341,4071,2012,Regularized Off-Policy TD-Learning,"We present a novel $l_1$ regularized off-policy convergent TD-learning method (termed RO-TD), which is able to learn sparse representations of value functions with low computational complexity. The algorithmic framework underlying RO-TD integrates two key ideas: off-policy convergent gradient TD methods, such as TDC, and a convex-concave saddle-point formulation of non-smooth convex optimization, which enables first-order solvers and feature selection using online convex regularization. A detailed theoretical and experimental analysis of RO-TD is presented. A variety of experiments are presented to illustrate the off-policy convergence, sparse feature selection capability and low computational cost of the RO-TD algorithm."
1342,4072,2012,Image Denoising and Inpainting with Deep Neural Networks,"We present a novel approach to low-level vision problems that combines sparse coding and deep networks pre-trained with denoising auto-encoder (DA). We propose an alternative training scheme that successfully adapts DA, originally designed for unsupervised feature learning, to the tasks of image denoising and blind inpainting. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the image denoising task. More importantly, in blind image inpainting task, the proposed method provides solutions to some complex problems that have not been tackled before. Specifically, we can automatically remove complex patterns like superimposed text from an image, rather than simple patterns like pixels missing at random. Moreover, the proposed method does not need the information regarding the region that requires inpainting to be given a priori. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the tasks of image denoising and blind inpainting. We also show that our new training scheme for DA is more effective and can improve the performance of unsupervised feature learning."
1343,4073,2012,Large Scale Distributed Deep Networks,"Recent work in unsupervised feature learning and deep learning has shown that  being able to train large models can dramatically improve performance.  In this  paper, we consider the problem of training a deep network with billions of  parameters using tens of thousands of CPU cores.  We have developed a  software framework called DistBelief that can utilize computing clusters  with thousands of machines to train large models.  Within this framework, we  have developed two algorithms for large-scale distributed training: (i) Downpour  SGD, an asynchronous stochastic gradient descent procedure supporting a  large number of model replicas, and (ii) Sandblaster, a framework that supports  for a variety of distributed batch optimization procedures, including a distributed  implementation of L-BFGS.  Downpour SGD and Sandblaster L-BFGS both  increase the scale and speed of deep network training.  We have successfully  used our system to train a deep network 100x larger than previously reported in  the literature, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet, a visual  object recognition task with 16 million images and 21k categories.  We show that  these same techniques dramatically accelerate the training of a more modestly  sized deep network for a commercial speech recognition service. Although we  focus on and report performance of these methods as applied to training large  neural networks, the underlying algorithms are applicable to any gradient-based  machine learning algorithm."
1344,4074,2012,Semi-Crowdsourced Clustering: Generalizing Crowd Labeling by Robust Distance Metric Learning,"One of the main challenges in data clustering is to define an appropriate similarity measure between two objects. Crowdclustering addresses this challenge by defining the pairwise similarity based on the manual annotations obtained through crowdsourcing. Despite its encouraging results, a key limitation of crowdclustering is that it can only cluster objects when their manual annotations are available. To address this limitation, we propose a new approach for clustering, called \textit{semi-crowdsourced clustering} that effectively combines the low-level features of objects with the manual annotations of a subset of the objects obtained via crowdsourcing. The key idea is to learn an appropriate similarity measure, based on the low-level features of objects, from the manual annotations of only a small portion of the data to be clustered. One difficulty in learning the pairwise similarity measure is that there is a significant amount of noise and inter-worker variations in the manual annotations obtained via crowdsourcing. We address this difficulty by developing a metric learning algorithm based on the matrix completion method. Our empirical study with two real-world image data sets shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art distance metric learning algorithms in both clustering accuracy and computational efficiency."
1345,4075,2012,Selecting Diverse Features via Spectral Regularization,"We study the problem of diverse feature selection in linear regression: selecting a small subset of diverse features that can predict a given objective. Diversity is useful for several reasons such as interpretability, robustness to noise, etc.  We propose several spectral regularizers that capture a notion of diversity of features and show that these are all submodular set functions. These regularizers, when added to the objective function for linear regression, result in approximately submodular functions, which can then be maximized approximately by efficient greedy and local search algorithms, with provable guarantees.  We compare our algorithms to traditional greedy and $\ell_1$-regularization schemes and show that we obtain a more diverse set of features that result in the regression problem being stable under perturbations."
1346,4077,2012,Towards a learning-theoretic analysis of spike-timing dependent plasticity,"This paper suggests a learning-theoretic perspective on how synaptic plasticity benefits global brain functioning. We introduce a model, the selectron, that (i) arises as the fast time constant limit of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons equipped with spiking timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and (ii) is amenable to theoretical analysis. We show that the selectron encodes reward estimates into spikes and that an error bound on spikes is controlled by a spiking margin and the sum of synaptic weights. Moreover, the efficacy of spikes (their usefulness to other reward maximizing selectrons) also depends on total synaptic strength. Finally, based on our analysis, we propose a regularized version of STDP, and show the regularization improves the robustness of neuronal learning when faced with multiple stimuli."
1347,4078,2012,Shifting Weights: Adapting Object Detectors from Image to Video,"Typical object detectors trained on images perform poorly on video, as there is a clear distinction in domain between the two types of data. In this paper, we tackle the problem of adapting object detectors learned from images to work well on videos. We treat the problem as one of unsupervised domain adaptation, in which we are given labeled data from the source domain (image), but only unlabeled data from the target domain (video). Our approach, self-paced domain adaptation, seeks to iteratively adapt the detector by re-training the detector with automatically discovered target domain examples, starting with the easiest first. At each iteration, the algorithm adapts by considering an increased number of target domain examples, and a decreased number of source domain examples. To discover target domain examples from the vast amount of video data, we introduce a simple, robust approach that scores trajectory tracks instead of bounding boxes. We also show how rich and expressive features specific to the target domain can be incorporated under the same framework. We show promising results on the 2011 TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection and LabelMe Video datasets that illustrate the benefit of our approach to adapt object detectors to video."
1348,4080,2012,Robustness and risk-sensitivity in Markov decision processes,"We uncover relations between robust MDPs and risk-sensitive MDPs.  The objective of a robust MDP is to minimize a function, such as the expectation of cumulative cost, for the worst case when the parameters have uncertainties.  The objective of a risk-sensitive MDP is to minimize a risk measure of the cumulative cost when the parameters are known.  We show that a risk-sensitive MDP of minimizing the expected exponential utility is equivalent to a robust MDP of minimizing the worst-case expectation with a penalty for the deviation of the uncertain parameters from their nominal values, which is measured with the Kullback-Leibler divergence.  We also show that a risk-sensitive MDP of minimizing an iterated risk measure that is composed of certain coherent risk measures is equivalent to a robust MDP of minimizing the worst-case expectation when the possible deviations of uncertain parameters from their nominal values are characterized with a concave function."
1349,4081,2012,"Neuronal Spike Generation Mechanism as an Oversampling, Noise-shaping A-to-D converter","We explore the hypothesis that the neuronal spike generation mechanism is an analog-to-digital converter, which rectifies low-pass filtered summed synaptic currents and encodes them into spike trains linearly decodable in post-synaptic neurons. To digitally encode an analog current waveform, the sampling rate of the spike generation mechanism must exceed its Nyquist rate. Such oversampling is consistent with the experimental observation that the precision of the spike-generation mechanism is an order of magnitude greater than the cut-off frequency of dendritic low-pass filtering. To achieve additional reduction in the error of analog-to-digital conversion, electrical engineers rely on noise-shaping. If noise-shaping were used in neurons, it would introduce correlations in spike timing to reduce low-frequency (up to Nyquist) transmission error at the cost of high-frequency one (from Nyquist to sampling rate). Using experimental data from three different classes of neurons, we demonstrate that biological neurons utilize noise-shaping. We also argue that rectification by the spike-generation mechanism may improve energy efficiency and carry out de-noising. Finally, the zoo of ion channels in neurons may be viewed as a set of predictors, various subsets of which are activated depending on the statistics of the input current."
1350,4082,2012,Coding efficiency and detectability of rate fluctuations with non-Poisson neuronal firing,"Statistical features of neuronal spike trains are known to be non-Poisson. Here, we investigate the extent to which the non-Poissonian feature affects the efficiency of transmitting information on fluctuating firing rates. For this purpose, we introduce the Kullbuck-Leibler (KL) divergence as a measure of the efficiency of information encoding, and assume that spike trains are generated by time-rescaled renewal processes. We show that the KL divergence determines the lower bound of the degree of rate fluctuations below which the temporal variation of the firing rates is undetectable from sparse data. We also show that the KL divergence, as well as the lower bound, depends not only on the variability of spikes in terms of the coefficient of variation, but also significantly on the higher-order moments of interspike interval (ISI) distributions. We examine three specific models that are commonly used for describing the stochastic nature of spikes (the gamma, inverse Gaussian (IG) and lognormal ISI distributions), and find that the time-rescaled renewal process with the IG distribution achieves the largest KL divergence, followed by the lognormal and gamma distributions."
1351,4083,2012,Mixing Properties of Conditional Markov Chains with Unbounded Feature Functions,"Conditional Markov Chains (also known as Linear-Chain Conditional Random Fields  in the literature) are a versatile class of discriminative models for the distribution of a sequence of hidden states conditional on a sequence of observable variables. Large-sample properties of Conditional Markov Chains have been first studied by Sinn and Poupart [1]. The paper extends this work in two directions: first, mixing properties of models with unbounded feature functions are being established; second, necessary conditions for model identifiability and the uniqueness of maximum likelihood estimates are being given."
1352,4085,2012,Efficient Spike-Coding with Multiplicative Adaptation in a Spike Response Model,"Neural adaptation underlies the ability of neurons to maximize encoded information over a wide dynamic range of input stimuli. While adaptation is an intrinsic feature of neuronal models like the Hodgkin-Huxley model, the challenge is to integrate adaptation in models of neural computation.  Recent computational models like the Adaptive Spike Response Model implement adaptation as spike-based addition of fixed-size fast spike-triggered threshold dynamics and slow spike-triggered currents. Such adaptation has been shown to accurately model neural spiking behavior over a limited dynamic range. Taking a cue from kinetic models of adaptation, we propose a multiplicative Adaptive Spike Response Model where the spike-triggered adaptation dynamics are scaled multiplicatively by the adaptation state at the time of spiking. We show that unlike the additive adaptation model, the firing rate in the multiplicative adaptation model saturates to a maximum spike-rate. When simulating variance switching experiments, the model also quantitatively fits the experimental data over a wide dynamic range. Furthermore, dynamic threshold models of adaptation suggest a straightforward interpretation of neural activity in terms of dynamic signal encoding with shifted and weighted exponential kernels. We show that when thus encoding rectified filtered stimulus signals, the multiplicative Adaptive Spike Response Model achieves a high coding efficiency and maintains this efficiency over changes in the dynamic signal range of several orders of magnitude, without changing model parameters."
1353,4086,2012,On the Sample Complexity of Robust PCA,"We estimate the sample complexity of a recent robust estimator for a generalized version of the inverse covariance matrix. This estimator is used in a convex algorithm for robust subspace recovery (i.e., robust PCA). Our model assumes a sub-Gaussian underlying distribution and an i.i.d.~sample from it. Our main result shows with high probability that the norm of the difference between the generalized inverse covariance of the underlying distribution and its estimator from an i.i.d.~sample of size $N$ is of order $O(N^{-0.5+\eps})$ for arbitrarily small $\eps>0$ (affecting the probabilistic estimate); this rate of convergence is close to one of direct covariance and inverse covariance estimation, i.e., $O(N^{-0.5})$. Our precise probabilistic estimate implies for some natural settings that the sample complexity of the generalized inverse covariance estimation when using the Frobenius norm is $O(D^{2+\delta})$ for arbitrarily small $\delta>0$ (whereas the sample complexity of direct covariance estimation with Frobenius norm is $O(D^{2})$). These results provide similar rates of convergence and sample complexity for the corresponding robust subspace recovery algorithm, which are close to those of PCA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only work analyzing the sample complexity of any robust PCA algorithm."
1354,4089,2012,Collaborative Gaussian Processes for Preference Learning,"We present a new model based on Gaussian processes (GPs) for learning pairwise preferences expressed by multiple users. Inference is simplified by using a \emph{preference kernel} for GPs which allows us to combine supervised GP learning of user preferences with unsupervised dimensionality reduction for multi-user systems. The model not only exploits collaborative information from the shared structure in user behavior, but may also incorporate user features if they are available. Approximate inference is implemented using a combination of expectation propagation and variational Bayes. Finally, we present an efficient active learning strategy for querying preferences. The proposed technique performs favorably on real-world data against state-of-the-art multi-user preference learning algorithms."
1355,4090,2012,Iterative ranking from pair-wise comparisons,"The question of aggregating pairwise comparisons to obtain a global ranking over a collection of objects has been of interest for a very long time: be it ranking of online gamers (e.g. MSR?s TrueSkill system) and chess players, aggregating social opinions, or deciding which product to sell based on transactions. In most settings, in addition to obtaining ranking, finding ?scores? for each object (e.g. player?s rating) is of interest to understanding the intensity of the preferences.   In this paper, we propose a novel iterative rank aggregation algorithm for discovering scores for objects from pairwise comparisons. The algorithm has a natural random walk interpretation over the graph of objects with edges present between two objects if they are compared; the scores turn out to be the stationary probability of this random walk. The algorithm is model independent. To establish the efficacy of our method, however, we consider the popular Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model in which each object has an associated score which determines the probabilistic outcomes of pairwise comparisons between objects. We bound the finite sample error rates between the scores assumed by the BTL model and those estimated by our algorithm. This, in essence, leads to order-optimal dependence on the number of samples required to learn the scores well by our algorithm. Indeed, the experimental evaluation shows that our (model independent) algorithm performs as well as the Maximum Likelihood Estimator of the BTL model and outperforms a recently proposed algorithm by Ammar and Shah [1]."
1356,4092,2012,The topographic unsupervised learning of natural sounds in the auditory cortex,"The computational modelling of the primary auditory cortex (A1) has been less fruitful than that of the primary visual cortex (V1) due to the less organized properties of A1. Greater disorder has recently been demonstrated for the tonotopy of A1 that has traditionally been considered to be as ordered as the retinotopy of V1. This disorder appears to be incongruous, given the uniformity of the neocortex; however, we hypothesized that both A1 and V1 would adopt an efficient coding strategy and that the disorder in A1 reflects natural sound statistics. To provide a computational model of the tonotopic disorder in A1, we used a model that was originally proposed for the smooth V1 map. In contrast to natural images, natural sounds exhibit distant correlations, which were learned and reflected in the disordered map. The auditory model predicted harmonic relationships among neighbouring A1 cells; furthermore, the same mechanism used to model V1 complex cells reproduced nonlinear responses similar to the pitch selectivity. These results contribute to the understanding of the sensory cortices of different modalities in a novel and integrated manner."
1357,4093,2012,Deep Representations and Codes for Image Auto-Annotation,"The task of assigning a set of relevant tags to an image is challenging due to the size and variability of tag vocabularies. Consequently, most existing algorithms focus on tag assignment and fix an often large number of hand-crafted features to describe image characteristics. In this paper we introduce a hierarchical model for learning representations of full sized color images from the pixel level, removing the need for engineered feature representations and subsequent feature selection. We benchmark our model on the STL-10 recognition dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance. When our features are combined with TagProp (Guillaumin et al.), we outperform or compete with existing annotation approaches that use over a dozen distinct image descriptors. Furthermore, using 256-bit codes and Hamming distance for training TagProp, we exchange only a small reduction in performance for efficient storage and fast comparisons. In our experiments, using deeper architectures always outperform shallow ones."
1358,4094,2012,Finding Exemplars from Pairwise Dissimilarities via Simultaneous Sparse Recovery,"Given pairwise dissimilarities between data points, we consider the problem of finding a subset of data points called representatives or exemplars that can efficiently describe the data collection. We formulate the problem as a row-sparsity regularized trace minimization problem which can be solved efficiently using convex programming. The solution of the proposed optimization program finds the representatives and the probability that each data point is associated to each one of the representatives. We obtain the range of the regularization parameter for which the solution of the proposed optimization program changes from selecting one representative to selecting all data points as the representatives. When data points are distributed around multiple clusters according to the dissimilarities, we show that the data in each cluster select only representatives from that cluster. Unlike metric-based methods, our algorithm does not require that the pairwise dissimilarities be metrics and can be applied to dissimilarities that are asymmetric or violate the triangle inequality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on synthetic data as well as real-world datasets of images and text."
1359,4095,2012,Locally Uniform Comparison Image Descriptor,"Keypoint matching between pairs of images using popular descriptors like SIFT or a faster variant called SURF is at the heart of many computer vision algorithms including recognition, mosaicing, and structure from motion. For real-time mobile applications, very fast but less accurate descriptors like BRIEF and related methods use a random sampling of pairwise comparisons of pixel intensities in an image patch. Here, we introduce Locally Uniform Comparison Image Descriptor (LUCID), a simple description method based on permutation distances between the ordering of intensities of RGB values between two patches. LUCID is computable in linear time with respect to patch size and does not require floating point computation. An analysis reveals an underlying issue that limits the potential of BRIEF and related approaches compared to LUCID. Experiments demonstrate that LUCID is faster than BRIEF, and its accuracy is directly comparable to SURF while being more than an order of magnitude faster."
1360,4096,2012,Expectation Propagation in Gaussian Process Dynamical Systems,"Rich and complex time-series data, such as those generated from engineering sys- tems, financial markets, videos or neural recordings are now a common feature of modern data analysis. Explaining the phenomena underlying these diverse data sets requires flexible and accurate models. In this paper, we promote Gaussian process dynamical systems as a rich model class appropriate for such analysis. In particular, we present a message passing algorithm for approximate inference in GPDSs based on expectation propagation. By phrasing inference as a general mes- sage passing problem, we iterate forward-backward smoothing. We obtain more accurate posterior distributions over latent structures, resulting in improved pre- dictive performance compared to state-of-the-art GPDS smoothers, which are spe- cial cases of our general iterative message passing algorithm. Hence, we provide a unifying approach within which to contextualize message passing in GPDSs."
1361,4097,2012,Graphical Gaussian Vector for Image Categorization,"This paper proposes a novel image representation called a Graphical Gaussian Vector, which is a counterpart of the codebook and local feature matching approaches. In our method, we model the distribution of local features as a Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) which can efficiently represent the spatial relationship among local features. We consider the parameter of GMRF as a feature vector of the image. Using concepts of information geometry, proper parameters and a metric from the GMRF can be obtained. Finally we define a new image feature by embedding the metric into the parameters, which can be directly applied to scalable linear classifiers. Our method obtains superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods in the standard object recognition datasets and comparable performance in the scene dataset. As the proposed method simply calculates the local auto-correlations of local features, it is able to achieve both high classification accuracy and high efficiency."
1362,4098,2012,No-Regret Algorithms for Unconstrained Online Convex Optimization,"Some of the most compelling applications of online convex optimization, including online prediction and classification, are unconstrained: the natural feasible set is R^n.  Existing algorithms fail to achieve sub-linear regret in this setting unless constraints on the comparator point x* are known in advance.  We present an algorithm that, without such prior knowledge, offers near-optimal regret bounds with respect to _any_ choice of x*.  In particular, regret with respect to x* = 0 is _constant_.  We then prove lower bounds showing that our algorithm's guarantees are optimal in this setting up to constant factors."
1363,4100,2012,Q-MKL: Matrix-induced Regularization in Multi-Kernel Learning with Applications to Neuroimaging,"Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) generalizes SVMs to the setting where one simultaneously trains a linear classifier and chooses an optimal combination of given base kernels. Model complexity is typically controlled using various norm regularizations on the vector of base kernel mixing coefficients. Existing methods, however, neither regularize nor exploit potentially useful information pertaining to how kernels in the input set 'interact'; that is, higher order kernel-pair relationships that can be easily obtained via unsupervised (similarity, geodesics), supervised (correlation in errors), or domain knowledge driven mechanisms (which features were used to construct the kernel?). We show that by substituting the norm penalty with an arbitrary quadratic function Q \succeq 0, one can impose a desired covariance structure on mixing coefficient selection, and use this as an inductive bias when learning the concept. This formulation significantly generalizes the widely used 1- and 2-norm MKL objectives. We explore the model?s utility via experiments on a challenging Neuroimaging problem, where the goal is to predict a subject?s conversion to Alzheimer?s Disease (AD) by exploiting aggregate information from several distinct imaging modalities. Here, our new model outperforms the state of the art (p-values << 10?3 ). We briefly discuss ramifications in terms of learning bounds (Rademacher complexity)."
1364,4101,2012,Persistent Homology for Learning Densities with Bounded Support,"We present a novel method for learning densities with bounded support which enables us to incorporate `hard' topological constraints. In particular, we show how emerging techniques from computational algebraic topology and the notion of Persistent Homology can be combined with kernel based  methods from Machine Learning for the purpose of density estimation. The proposed formalism facilitates learning of models with bounded support in a principled way, and -- by incorporating Persistent Homology techniques in our approach -- we are able to encode algebraic-topological constraints which are not addressed in current state-of the art probabilistic models. We study the behaviour of our method on two synthetic examples for various sample sizes and exemplify the benefits of the proposed approach on a real-world data-set by learning a motion model for a racecar. We show how to learn a model which respects the underlying topological structure of the racetrack, constraining the trajectories of the car."
1365,4102,2012,Timely Object Recognition,"In a large visual multi-class detection framework, the timeliness of results can be crucial. Our method for timely multi-class detection aims to give the best possible performance at any single point after a start time; it is terminated at a deadline time. Toward this goal, we formulate a dynamic, closed-loop policy that infers the contents of the image in order to decide which detector to deploy next. In contrast to previous work, our method significantly diverges from the predominant greedy strategies, and is able to learn to take actions with deferred values. We evaluate our method with a novel timeliness measure, computed as the area under an Average Precision vs. Time curve. Experiments are conducted on the eminent PASCAL VOC object detection dataset. If execution is stopped when only half the detectors have been run, our method obtains $66\%$ better AP than a random ordering, and $14\%$ better performance than an intelligent baseline. On the timeliness measure, our method obtains at least $11\%$ better performance. Our code, to be made available upon publication, is easily extensible as it treats detectors and classifiers as black boxes and learns from execution traces using reinforcement learning."
1366,4103,2012,Scaled Gradients on Grassmann Manifolds for Matrix Completion,"This paper describes gradient methods based on a scaled metric on the Grassmann manifold for low-rank matrix completion. The proposed methods significantly improve canonical gradient methods especially on ill-conditioned matrices, while maintaining established global convegence and exact recovery guarantees. A connection between a form of subspace iteration for matrix completion and the scaled gradient descent procedure is also established. The proposed conjugate gradient method based on the scaled gradient outperforms several existing algorithms for matrix completion and is competitive with recently proposed methods."
1367,4104,2012,Unsupervised Template Learning for Fine-Grained Object Recognition,"Fine-grained recognition refers to a subordinate level of recognition, such are recognizing different species of birds, animals or plants. It differs from recognition of basic categories, such as humans, tables, and computers, in that there are global similarities in shape or structure shared within a category, and the differences are in the details of the object parts. We suggest that the key to identifying the fine-grained differences lies in finding the right alignment of image regions that contain the same object parts. We propose a template model for the purpose, which captures common shape patterns of object parts, as well as the co-occurence relation of the shape patterns. Once the image regions are aligned, extracted features are used for classification. Learning of the template model is efficient, and the recognition results we achieve significantly outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms."
1368,4105,2012,How They Vote: Issue-Adjusted Models of Legislative Behavior,"We develop a probabilistic model of legislative data that uses the text of the bills to uncover lawmakers' positions on specific political issues.  Our model can be used to explore how a lawmaker's voting patterns deviate from what is expected and how that deviation depends on what is being voted on. We derive approximate posterior inference algorithms based on variational methods. Across 12 years of legislative data, we demonstrate both improvement in heldout predictive performance and the model's utility in interpreting an inherently multi-dimensional space."
1369,4106,2012,Topology Constraints in Graphical Models,"Graphical models are a very useful tool to describe and understand natural phenomena, from gene expression to climate change and social interactions. The topological structure of these graphs/networks is a fundamental part of the analysis, and in many cases the main goal of the study. However, little work has been done on incorporating prior topological knowledge onto the estimation of the underlying graphical models from sample data. In this work we propose extensions to the basic joint regression model for network estimation, which explicitly incorporate graph-topological constraints into the corresponding optimization approach. The first proposed extension includes an eigenvector centrality constraint, thereby promoting this important prior topological property. The second developed extension promotes the formation of certain motifs, triangle-shaped ones in particular, which are known to exist for example in genetic regulatory networks. The presentation of the underlying formulations, which serve as examples of the introduction of topological constraints in network estimation, is complemented with examples in diverse datasets demonstrating the importance of incorporating such critical prior knowledge."
1370,4107,2012,Searching for objects driven by context,"The dominant visual search paradigm for object class detection is sliding windows. Although simple and effective, it is also wasteful, unnatural and rigidly hardwired. We propose strategies to search for objects which intelligently explore the space of windows by making sequential observations at locations decided based on previous observations. Our strategies adapt to the class being searched and to the content of a particular test image. Their driving force is exploiting context as the statistical relation between the appearance of a window and its location relative to the object, as observed in the training set. In addition to being more elegant than sliding windows, we demonstrate experimentally on the PASCAL VOC 2010 dataset that our strategies evaluate two orders of magnitude fewer windows while at the same time achieving higher detection accuracy."
1371,4108,2012,Analog readout for optical reservoir computers,"Reservoir computing is a new, powerful and flexible machine learning technique that is easily implemented in hardware. Recently, by using a time-multiplexed architecture, hardware reservoir computers have reached performance comparable to digital implementations. Operating speeds allowing for real time information operation have been reached using optoelectronic systems. At present the main performance bottleneck is the readout layer which uses slow, digital postprocessing. We have designed an analog readout suitable for time-multiplexed optoelectronic reservoir computers, capable of working in real time. The readout has been built and tested experimentally on a standard benchmark task. Its performance is better than non-reservoir methods, with ample room for further improvement. The present work thereby overcomes one of the major limitations for the future development of hardware reservoir computers."
1372,4109,2012,"Burn-in, bias, and the rationality of anchoring","Bayesian inference provides a unifying framework for addressing problems in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and robotics, as well as the problems facing the human mind. Unfortunately, exact Bayesian inference is intractable in all but the simplest models. Therefore minds and machines have to approximate Bayesian inference. Approximate inference algorithms can achieve a wide range of time-accuracy tradeoffs, but what is the optimal tradeoff? We investigate time-accuracy tradeoffs using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as a metaphor for the mind's inference algorithm(s). We find that reasonably accurate decisions are possible long before the Markov chain has converged to the posterior distribution, i.e. during the period known as burn-in. Therefore the strategy that is optimal subject to the mind's bounded processing speed and opportunity costs may perform so few iterations that the resulting samples are biased towards the initial value. The resulting cognitive process model provides a rational basis for the anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic. The model's quantitative predictions are tested against published data on anchoring in numerical estimation tasks. Our theoretical and empirical results suggest that the anchoring bias is consistent with approximate Bayesian inference."
1373,4111,2012,Multiresolution analysis on the symmetric group,"There is no generally accepted way to define wavelets on permutations. We address this issue by introducing the notion of coset based multiresolution analysis (CMRA) on the symmetric group; find the corresponding wavelet functions; and describe a fast wavelet transform of O(n^p) complexity with small p for sparse signals (in contrast to the O(n^q n!) complexity typical of FFTs). We discuss potential applications in ranking, sparse approximation, and multi-object tracking."
1374,4112,2012,Algorithms for Learning Markov Field Policies,"We present a new graph-based approach for incorporating domain knowledge in reinforcement learning applications. The domain knowledge is given as a weighted graph, or a kernel matrix, that loosely indicates which states should have similar optimal actions. We first introduce a bias into the policy search process by deriving a distribution on policies such that policies that disagree with the provided graph have low probabilities. This distribution corresponds to a Markov Random Field. We then present a reinforcement and an apprenticeship learning algorithms for finding such policy distributions. We also illustrate the advantage of the proposed approach on three problems: swing-up cart-balancing with nonuniform and smooth frictions, gridworlds, and teaching a robot to grasp new objects."
1375,4113,2012,Assessing Blinding in Clinical Trials,"The interaction between the patient's expected outcome of an intervention and the inherent effects of that intervention can have extraordinary effects. Thus in clinical trials an effort is made to conceal the nature of the administered intervention from the participants in the trial i.e. to blind it. Yet, in practice perfect blinding is impossible to ensure or even verify. The current standard is follow up the trial with an auxiliary questionnaire, which allows trial participants to express their belief concerning the assigned intervention and which is used to compute a measure of the extent of blinding in the trial. If the estimated extent of blinding exceeds a threshold the trial is deemed sufficiently blinded; otherwise, the trial is deemed to have failed. In this paper we make several important contributions. Firstly, we identify a series of fundamental problems of the aforesaid practice and discuss them in context of the most commonly used blinding measures. Secondly, motivated by the highlighted problems, we formulate a novel method for handling imperfectly blinded trials. We too adopt a post-trial feedback questionnaire but interpret the collected data using an original approach, fundamentally different from those previously proposed. Unlike previous approaches, ours is void of any ad hoc free parameters, is robust to small changes in auxiliary data and is not predicated on any strong assumptions used to interpret participants' feedback."
1376,4114,2012,Density Propagation and Improved Bounds on the Partition Function,"Given a probabilistic graphical model, its density of states is a function that, for any likelihood value, gives the number of configurations with that probability. We introduce a novel message-passing algorithm called Density Propagation (DP) for estimating this function. We show that DP is exact for tree-structured graphical models and is, in general, a strict generalization of both sum-product and max-product algorithms. Further, we use density of states and tree decomposition to introduce a new family of upper and lower bounds on the partition function. For any tree decompostion, the new upper bound based on finer-grained density of state information is provably at least as tight as previously known bounds based on convexity of the log-partition function, and strictly stronger if a general condition holds. We conclude with empirical evidence of improvement over convex relaxations and mean-field based bounds."
1377,4115,2012,Adaptive Learning of Smoothing Functions: Application to Electricity Load Forecasting,"This paper proposes an efficient online learning algorithm to track the smoothing functions of Additive Models. The key idea is to combine the linear representation of Additive Models with a Recursive Least Squares (RLS) filter. In order to quickly track changes in the model and put more weight on recent data, the RLS filter uses a forgetting factor which exponentially weights down observations by the order of their arrival. The tracking behaviour is further enhanced by using an adaptive forgetting factor which is updated based on the gradient of the a priori errors. Using results from Lyapunov stability theory, upper bounds for the learning rate are analyzed. The proposed algorithm is applied to 5 years of electricity load data provided by the French utility company Electricite de France (EDF). Compared to state-of-the-art methods, it achieves a superior performance in terms of model tracking and prediction accuracy."
1378,4116,2012,Local Supervised Learning through Space Partitioning,"We develop a novel approach for supervised learning based on adaptively partitioning the feature space into different regions and learning local region-specific classifiers. We formulate an empirical risk minimization problem that incorporates both partitioning and classification in to a single global objective. We show that space partitioning can be equivalently reformulated as a supervised learning problem and consequently any discriminative learning method can be utilized in conjunction with our approach. Nevertheless, we consider locally linear schemes by learning linear partitions and linear region classifiers. Locally linear schemes can not only approximate complex decision boundaries and ensure low training error but also provide tight control on over-fitting and generalization error. We train locally linear classifiers by using LDA, logistic regression and perceptrons, and so our scheme is scalable to large data sizes and high-dimensions. We present experimental results demonstrating improved performance over state of the art classification techniques on benchmark datasets. We also show improved robustness to label noise."
1379,4117,2012,Convergence and Energy Landscape for Cheeger Cut Clustering,"Unsupervised clustering of scattered, noisy and high-dimensional data points is an important and difficult problem. Continuous relaxations of balanced cut problems  yield excellent clustering results. This paper provides rigorous convergence results for two algorithms that solve the relaxed Cheeger Cut minimization.  The first algorithm is a new steepest descent algorithm and the second one is a slight modification of the Inverse Power Method algorithm \cite{pro:HeinBuhler10OneSpec}. While the steepest descent algorithm has better theoretical convergence properties,  in practice both algorithm perform equally.  We also completely characterize the local minima of the relaxed problem in terms of the original balanced cut problem, and relate this characterization to the convergence of the algorithms."
1380,4118,2012,Optimal kernel choice for large-scale two-sample tests,"Abstract Given samples from distributions $p$ and $q$, a two-sample test determines whether to reject the null hypothesis that $p=q$, based on the value of a test statistic measuring the distance between the samples. One choice of test statistic is the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), which is a distance between embeddings of the probability distributions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The kernel used in obtaining these embeddings is thus critical in ensuring the test has high power, and correctly distinguishes unlike distributions with high probability. A means of parameter selection for the two-sample test based on the MMD is proposed. For a given test level (an upper bound on the probability of making a Type I error), the kernel is chosen so as to maximize the test power, and minimize the probability of making a Type II error. The test statistic, test threshold, and optimization over the kernel parameters are obtained with cost linear in the sample size. These properties make the kernel selection and test procedures suited to data streams, where the observations cannot all be stored in memory. In experiments, the new kernel selection approach yields a more powerful test than earlier kernel selection heuristics."
1381,4119,2012,Communication-Efficient Algorithms for Statistical Optimization,"We study two communication-efficient algorithms for distributed statistical optimization on large-scale data. The first algorithm is an averaging method that distributes the $N$ data samples evenly to $m$ machines, performs separate minimization on each subset, and then averages the estimates.  We provide a sharp analysis of this average mixture algorithm, showing that under a reasonable set of conditions, the combined parameter achieves mean-squared error that decays as $\order(N^{-1}+(N/m)^{-2})$. Whenever $m \le \sqrt{N}$, this guarantee matches the best possible rate achievable by a centralized algorithm having access to all $N$ samples.  The second algorithm is a novel method, based on an appropriate form of the bootstrap.  Requiring only a single round of communication, it has mean-squared error that decays as $\order(N^{-1}+(N/m)^{-3})$, and so is more robust to the amount of parallelization. We complement our theoretical results with experiments on large-scale problems from the Microsoft Learning to Rank dataset."
1382,4120,2012,Multi-Stage Multi-Task Feature Learning,"Multi-task sparse feature learning aims to improve the generalization performance by exploiting the shared features among tasks. It has been successfully applied to many applications including computer vision and biomedical informatics. Most of the existing multi-task sparse feature learning algorithms are formulated as a convex sparse regularization problem, which is usually suboptimal, due to its looseness for approximating an $\ell_0$-type regularizer. In this paper, we propose a non-convex formulation for multi-task sparse feature learning based on a novel regularizer. To solve the non-convex optimization problem, we propose a Multi-Stage Multi-Task Feature Learning (MSMTFL) algorithm. Moreover, we present a detailed theoretical analysis showing that MSMTFL achieves a better parameter estimation error bound than the convex formulation. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of MSMTFL in comparison with the state of the art multi-task sparse feature learning algorithms."
1383,4123,2012,Clustering Aggregation as Maximum-Weight Independent Set,"We formulate clustering aggregation as a special instance of Maximum-Weight Independent Set (MWIS) problem. For a given dataset, an attributed graph is constructed from the union of the input clusterings generated by different underlying clustering algorithms with different parameters. The vertices, which represent the distinct clusters, are weighted by an internal index measuring both cohesion and separation. The edges connect the vertices whose corresponding clusters overlap. Intuitively, an optimal aggregated clustering can be obtained by selecting an optimal subset of non-overlapping clusters partitioning the dataset together. We formalize this intuition as the MWIS problem on the attributed graph, i.e., finding the heaviest subset of mutually non-adjacent vertices.  This MWIS problem exhibits a special structure. Since the clusters of each input clustering form a partition of the dataset, the vertices corresponding to each clustering form a maximal independent set (MIS) in the attributed graph. We propose a variant of simulated annealing method that takes advantage of this special structure. Our algorithm starts from each MIS, which is close to a distinct local optimum of the MWIS problem, and utilizes a local search heuristic to explore its neighborhood in order to find the MWIS. Extensive experiments on many challenging datasets show that: 1. our approach to clustering aggregation automatically decides the optimal number of clusters; 2. it does not require any parameter tuning for the underlying clustering algorithms; 3. it can combine the advantages of different underlying clustering algorithms to achieve superior performance; 4. it is robust against moderate or even bad input clusterings."
1384,4124,2012,Pointwise Tracking the Optimal Regression Function,"This paper examines the possibility of a `reject option' in the context of least squares regression. It is shown that using rejection it is theoretically possible to learn `selective' regressors that can $\epsilon$-pointwise track the best regressor in hindsight from the same hypothesis class, while rejecting only a bounded portion of the domain. Moreover, the rejected volume vanishes with the training set size, under certain conditions. We then develop efficient and exact implementation of these selective regressors for the case of linear regression. Empirical evaluation over a suite of real-world datasets corroborates the theoretical analysis and indicates that our selective regressors can provide substantial advantage by reducing estimation error."
1385,4125,2012,Fast Resampling Weighted v-Statistics,"In this paper, a novel, computationally fast, and alternative algorithm for com- puting weighted v-statistics in resampling both univariate and multivariate data is proposed. To avoid any real resampling, we have linked this problem with finite group action and converted it into a problem of orbit enumeration. For further computational cost reduction, an efficient method is developed to list all orbits by their symmetry order and calculate all index function orbit sums and data function orbit sums recursively. The computational complexity analysis shows reduction in the computational cost from n! or nn level to low-order polynomial level."
1386,4126,2012,Diffusion Decision Making for Adaptive k-Nearest Neighbor Classification,"This paper sheds light on some fundamental connections of the diffusion decision making model of neuroscience and cognitive psychology with k-nearest neighbor classification.  We show that conventional k-nearest neighbor classification can be viewed as a special problem of the diffusion decision model in the asymptotic situation.  Applying the optimal strategy associated with the diffusion decision model, an adaptive rule is developed for determining appropriate values of k in k-nearest neighbor classification.  Making use of the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) and Bayesian analysis, we propose five different criteria for adaptively acquiring nearest neighbors.  Experiments with both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectivness of our classification criteria."
1387,4128,2012,Minimizing Sparse High-Order Energies by Submodular Vertex-Cover,"Inference on high-order graphical models has become increasingly important in recent years.  We consider energies with simple 'sparse' high-order potentials.  Previous work in this area uses either specialized message-passing  or transforms each high-order potential to the pairwise case. We take a fundamentally different approach, transforming the entire original problem into a comparatively small instance of a submodular vertex-cover problem. These vertex-cover instances can then be attacked by standard pairwise methods, where they run much faster (4--15 times) and are often more effective than on the original problem. We evaluate our approach on synthetic data, and we show that our algorithm can be useful in a fast hierarchical clustering and model estimation framework."
1388,4129,2012,Nonparametric Bayesian Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Multiple Reward Functions,"We present a nonparametric Bayesian approach to inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) for multiple reward functions. Most previous IRL algorithms assume that the behaviour data is obtained from an agent who is optimizing a single reward function, but this assumption is hard to be met in practice. Our approach is based on integrating the Dirichlet process mixture model into Bayesian IRL. We provide an efficient Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm utilizing the gradient of the posterior to estimate the underlying reward functions, and demonstrate that our approach outperforms the previous ones via experiments on a number of problem domains."
1389,4130,2012,Spiking and saturating dendrites differentially expand single neuron computation capacity,"The integration of excitatory inputs in dendrites is non-linear: multiple excitatory inputs can produce a local depolarization departing from the arithmetic sum of each input's response taken separately. If this depolarization is bigger than the arithmetic sum, the dendrite is spiking; if the depolarization is smaller, the dendrite is saturating. Decomposing a dendritic tree into independent dendritic spiking units greatly extends its computational capacity, as the neuron then maps onto a two layer neural network, enabling it to compute linearly non-separable Boolean functions (lnBFs). How can these lnBFs be implemented by dendritic architectures in practise? And can saturating dendrites equally expand computational capacity? To adress these questions we use a binary neuron model and Boolean algebra. First, we confirm that spiking dendrites enable a neuron to compute lnBFs using an architecture based on the disjunctive normal form (DNF). Second, we prove that saturating dendrites as well as spiking dendrites also enable a neuron to compute lnBFs using an architecture based on the conjunctive normal form (CNF). Contrary to the DNF-based architecture, a CNF-based architecture leads to a dendritic unit tuning that does not imply the neuron tuning, as has been observed experimentally. Third, we show that one cannot use a DNF-based architecture with saturating dendrites. Consequently, we show that an important family of lnBFs implemented with a CNF-architecture can require an exponential number of saturating dendritic units, whereas the same family implemented with either a DNF-architecture or a CNF-architecture always require a linear number of spiking dendritic unit. This minimization could explain why a neuron spends energetic resources to make its dendrites spike."
1390,4131,2012,Clustering Sparse Graphs,"We develop a new algorithm to cluster sparse unweighted graphs -- i.e. partition the nodes into disjoint clusters so that there is higher density within clusters, and low across clusters. By sparsity we mean the setting where both the in-cluster and across cluster edge densities are very small, possibly vanishing in the size of the graph. Sparsity makes the problem noisier, and hence more difficult to solve.   Any clustering involves a tradeoff between minimizing two kinds of errors: missing edges within clusters and present edges across clusters. Our insight is that in the sparse case, these must be {\em penalized differently}. We analyze our algorithm's performance on the natural, classical and widely studied ``planted partition'' model (also called the stochastic block model); we show that our algorithm can cluster sparser graphs, and with smaller clusters, than all previous methods. This is seen empirically as well."
1391,4134,2012,Deep Neural Networks Segment Neuronal Membranes in Electron Microscopy Images,"We address a central problem of neuroanatomy, namely, the automatic segmentation of neuronal structures  depicted in stacks of electron microscopy (EM) images. This is necessary to efficiently map 3D brain structure and connectivity. To segment {\em biological} neuron membranes, we use a special type of deep {\em artificial} neural network as a pixel classifier. The label of each pixel (membrane or non-membrane) is predicted from raw pixel values in a square window centered on it. The input layer maps each window pixel to a neuron. It is followed by a succession of convolutional and max-pooling layers which preserve 2D information and extract features with increasing levels of abstraction. The output layer produces a calibrated probability for each class. The classifier is trained by plain gradient descent on a $512 \times 512 \times 30$ stack with known ground truth, and tested on a stack of the same  size (ground truth unknown to the authors) by the organizers of the ISBI 2012 EM Segmentation Challenge.  Even without problem-specific post-processing, our approach outperforms competing techniques by a large margin in all three considered metrics, i.e. \emph{rand error}, \emph{warping error} and \emph{pixel error}.  For pixel error, our approach is the only one outperforming a second human observer."
1392,4135,2012,Efficient and direct estimation of a neural subunit model for sensory coding,"Many visual and auditory neurons have response properties that are well explained by pooling the rectified responses of a set of self-similar linear filters. These filters cannot be found using spike-triggered averaging (STA), which estimates only a single filter. Other methods, like spike-triggered covariance (STC), define a multi-dimensional response subspace, but require substantial amounts of data and do not produce unique estimates of the linear filters. Rather, they provide a linear basis for the subspace in which the filters reside. Here, we define a 'subunit' model as an LN-LN cascade, in which the first linear stage is restricted to a set of shifted (""convolutional"") copies of a common filter, and the first nonlinear stage consists of rectifying nonlinearities that are identical for all filter outputs; we refer to these initial LN elements as the 'subunits' of the receptive field. The second linear stage then computes a weighted sum of the responses of the rectified subunits. We present a method for directly fitting this model to spike data. The method performs well for both simulated and real data (from primate V1), and the resulting model outperforms STA and STC in terms of both cross-validated accuracy and efficiency."
1393,4136,2012,The Coloured Noise Expansion and Parameter Estimation of Diffusion Processes,"Stochastic differential equations (SDE) are a natural tool for modelling systems that are inherently noisy or contain uncertainties that can be modelled as stochastic processes. Crucial to the process of using SDE to build mathematical models is the ability to estimate parameters of those models from observed data. Over the past few decades, significant progress has been made on this problem, but we are still far from having a definitive solution. We describe a novel method of approximating a diffusion process that we show to be useful in Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) inference algorithms. We take the ?white? noise that drives a diffusion process and decompose it into two terms. The first is a ?coloured noise? term that can be deterministically controlled by a set of auxilliary variables. The second term is small and enables us to form a linear Gaussian ?small noise? approximation. The decomposition allows us to take a diffusion process of interest and cast it in a form that is amenable to sampling by MCMC methods. We explain why many state-of-the-art inference methods fail on highly nonlinear inference problems. We demonstrate experimentally that our method performs well in such situations. Our results show that this method is a promising new tool for use in inference and parameter estimation problems."
1394,4137,2012,A latent factor model for highly multi-relational data,"Many data such as social networks, movie preferences or knowledge bases are multi-relational, in that they describe multiple relationships between entities. While there is a large body of work focused on modeling these data, few considered modeling these multiple types of relationships jointly. Further, existing approaches tend to breakdown when the number of these types grows. In this paper, we propose a method for modeling large multi-relational datasets, with possibly thousands of relations. Our model is based on a bilinear structure, which captures the various orders of interaction of the data, but also shares sparse latent factors across different relations. We illustrate the performance of our approach on standard tensor-factorization datasets where we attain, or outperform, state-of-the-art results. Finally, a NLP application demonstrates our scalability and the ability of our model to learn efficient, and semantically meaningful verb representations."
1395,4138,2012,A Scalable CUR Matrix Decomposition Algorithm: Lower Time Complexity and Tighter Bound,"The CUR matrix decomposition is an important extension of Nystr?m approximation to a general matrix. It approximates any data matrix in terms of a small number of its columns and rows. In this paper we propose a novel randomized CUR algorithm with an expected relative-error bound. The proposed algorithm has the advantages over the existing relative-error CUR algorithms that it possesses tighter theoretical bound and lower time complexity, and that it can avoid maintaining the whole data matrix in main memory. Finally, experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvement over the existing relative-error algorithms."
1396,4139,2012,MCMC for continuous-time discrete-state systems,"We propose a simple and novel framework for MCMC inference in continuous-time discrete-state systems with pure jump trajectories. We construct an exact MCMC sampler for such systems by alternately sampling a random discretization of time given a trajectory of the system, and then a new trajectory given the discretization.  The first step can be performed efficiently using properties of the Poisson process, while the second step can avail of discrete-time MCMC techniques based on the forward-backward algorithm. We compare our approach to particle MCMC and a uniformization-based sampler, and show its advantages."
1397,4140,2012,Learning with Recursive Perceptual Representations,"Linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have become very popular in vision as part of state-of-the-art object recognition and other classification tasks but require high dimensional feature spaces for good performance. Deep learning methods can find more compact representations but current methods employ multilayer perceptrons that require solving a difficult, non-convex optimization problem. We propose a deep non-linear classifier whose layers are SVMs and which incorporates random projection as its core stacking element. Our method learns layers of linear SVMs recursively transforming the original data manifold through a random projection of the weak prediction computed from each layer. Our method scales as linear SVMs, does not rely on any kernel computations or nonconvex optimization, and exhibits better generalization ability than kernel-based SVMs. This is especially true when the number of training samples is smaller than the dimensionality of data, a common scenario in many real-world applications. The use of random projections is key to our method, as we show in the experiments section, in which we observe a consistent improvement over previous --often more complicated-- methods on several vision and speech benchmarks."
1398,4141,2012,Automatic Feature Induction for Stagewise Collaborative Filtering,"Recent approaches to collaborative filtering have concentrated on estimating an algebraic or statistical model, and using the model for predicting missing ratings. In this paper we observe that different models have relative advantages in different regions of the input space. This motivates our approach of using stagewise linear combinations of collaborative filtering algorithms, with non-constant combination coefficients based on kernel smoothing. The resulting stagewise model is computationally scalable and outperforms a wide selection of state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms."
1399,4142,2012,From Deformations to Parts: Motion-based Segmentation of 3D Objects,"We develop a method for discovering the parts of an articulated object from aligned meshes capturing various three-dimensional (3D) poses.  We adapt the distance dependent Chinese restaurant process (ddCRP) to allow nonparametric discovery of a potentially unbounded number of parts, while simultaneously guaranteeing a spatially connected segmentation.  To allow analysis of datasets in which object instances have varying shapes, we model part variability across poses via affine transformations.  By placing a matrix normal-inverse-Wishart prior on these affine transformations, we develop a ddCRP Gibbs sampler which tractably marginalizes over transformation uncertainty.  Analyzing a dataset of humans captured in dozens of poses, we infer parts which provide quantitatively better motion predictions than conventional clustering methods."
1400,4144,2012,Learning optimal spike-based representations,"How do neural networks learn to represent information? Here, we address this question by assuming that neural networks seek to generate an optimal population representation for a fixed linear decoder. We define a loss function for the quality of the population read-out and derive the dynamical equations for both neurons and synapses from the requirement to minimize this loss. The dynamical equations yield a network of integrate-and-fire neurons undergoing Hebbian plasticity. We show that, through learning, initially regular and highly correlated spike trains evolve towards Poisson-distributed and independent spike trains with much lower firing rates. The learning rule drives the network into an asynchronous, balanced regime where all inputs to the network are represented optimally for the given decoder. We show that the network dynamics and synaptic plasticity jointly balance the excitation and inhibition received by each unit as tightly as possible and, in doing so, minimize the prediction error between the inputs and the decoded outputs. In turn, spikes are only signalled whenever this prediction error exceeds a certain value, thereby implementing a predictive coding scheme. Our work  suggests that several of the features reported in cortical networks, such as the high trial-to-trial variability, the balance between excitation and inhibition, and spike-timing dependent plasticity, are simply signatures of an efficient, spike-based code."
1401,4145,2012,Bayesian Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning,"We describe an approach to incorporating Bayesian priors in the maxq framework for hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL). We define priors on the primitive environment model and on task pseudo-rewards. Since models for composite tasks can be complex, we use a mixed model-based/model-free learning approach to find an optimal hierarchical policy. We show empirically that (i) our approach results in improved convergence over non-Bayesian baselines, given sensible priors, (ii) task hierarchies and Bayesian priors can be complementary sources of information, and using both sources is better than either alone, (iii) taking advantage of the structural decomposition induced by the task hierarchy significantly reduces the computational cost of Bayesian reinforcement learning and (iv) in this framework, task pseudo-rewards can be learned instead of being manually specified, leading to automatic learning of hierarchically optimal rather than recursively optimal policies."
1402,4146,2012,Risk-Aversion in Multi-armed Bandits,"In stochastic multi--armed bandits the objective is to solve the exploration--exploitation dilemma and ultimately maximize the expected reward. Nonetheless, in many practical problems, maximizing the expected reward is not the most desirable objective. In this paper, we introduce a novel setting based on the principle of risk--aversion where the objective is to compete against the arm with the best risk--return trade--off. This setting proves to be intrinsically more difficult than the standard multi-arm bandit setting due in part to an exploration risk which introduces a regret associated to the variability of an algorithm. Using variance as a measure of risk, we introduce two new algorithms, we investigate their theoretical guarantees, and we report preliminary empirical results."
1403,4147,2012,Convergence Rate Analysis of MAP Coordinate Minimization Algorithms,"Finding maximum aposteriori (MAP) assignments in graphical models is an important task in many applications. Since the problem is generally hard, linear programming (LP) relaxations are often used. Solving these relaxations efficiently is thus an important practical problem. In recent years, several authors have proposed message passing updates corresponding to coordinate descent in the dual LP. However,these are generally not guaranteed to converge to a global optimum. One approach to remedy this is to smooth the LP, and perform coordinate descent on the smoothed dual. However, little is known about the convergence rate of this procedure. Here we perform a thorough rate analysis of such schemes and derive primal and dual convergence rates. We also provide a simple dual to primal mapping that yields feasible primal solutions with a guaranteed rate of convergence. Empirical evaluation supports our theoretical claims and shows that the method is highly competitive with state of the art approaches that yield global optima."
1404,4148,2012,Approximating Equilibria in Sequential Auctions with Incomplete Information and Multi-Unit Demand,"In many large economic markets, goods are sold through sequential auctions. Such domains include eBay, online ad auctions, wireless spectrum auctions, and the Dutch flower auctions. Bidders in these domains face highly complex decision-making problems, as their preferences for outcomes in one auction often depend on the outcomes of other auctions, and bidders have limited information about factors that drive outcomes, such as other bidders' preferences and past actions.   In this work, we formulate the bidder's problem as one of price prediction (i.e., learning) and optimization. We define the concept of stable price predictions and show that (approximate) equilibrium in sequential auctions can be characterized as a profile of strategies that (approximately) optimize with respect to such (approximately) stable price predictions. We show how equilibria found with our formulation compare to known theoretical equilibria for simpler auction domains, and we find new approximate equilibria for a more complex auction domain where analytical solutions were heretofore unknown."
1405,4149,2012,Symbolic Dynamic Programming for Continuous State and Observation POMDPs,"Partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a powerful model for real-world sequential decision-making problems. In recent years, point- based value iteration methods have proven to be extremely effective techniques for ?nding (approximately) optimal dynamic programming solutions to POMDPs when an initial set of belief states is known. However, no point-based work has provided exact point-based backups for both continuous state and observation spaces, which we tackle in this paper. Our key insight is that while there may be an in?nite number of possible observations, there are only a ?nite number of observation partitionings that are relevant for optimal decision-making when a ?nite, ?xed set of reachable belief states is known. To this end, we make two important contributions: (1) we show how previous exact symbolic dynamic pro- gramming solutions for continuous state MDPs can be generalized to continu- ous state POMDPs with discrete observations, and (2) we show how this solution can be further extended via recently developed symbolic methods to continuous state and observations to derive the minimal relevant observation partitioning for potentially correlated, multivariate observation spaces. We demonstrate proof-of- concept results on uni- and multi-variate state and observation steam plant control."
1406,4150,2012,Online allocation and homogeneous partitioning for piecewise constant mean-approximation,"In the setting of active learning for the multi-armed bandit, where the goal of a learner is to estimate with equal precision the mean of a finite number of arms, recent results show that it is possible to derive strategies based on finite-time confidence bounds that are competitive with the best possible strategy. We here consider an extension of this problem to the case when the arms are the cells of a finite partition P of a continuous sampling space X \subset \Real^d. Our goal is now to build a piecewise constant approximation of a noisy function (where each piece is one region of P and P is fixed beforehand) in order to maintain the local quadratic error of approximation on each cell equally low. Although this extension is not trivial, we show that a simple algorithm based on upper confidence bounds can be proved to be adaptive to the function itself in a near-optimal way, when |P| is chosen to be of minimax-optimal order  on the class of \alpha-H?lder functions."
1407,4151,2012,"Natural Images, Gaussian Mixtures and Dead Leaves","Simple Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) learned from pixels of natural image patches have been recently shown to be surprisingly strong performers in modeling the statistics of natural images. Here we provide an in depth analysis of this simple yet rich model. We show that such a GMM model is able to compete with even the most successful models of natural images in log likelihood scores, denoising performance and sample quality. We provide an analysis of what such a model learns from natural images as a function of number of mixture components --- including covariance structure, contrast variation and intricate structures such as textures, boundaries and more. Finally, we show that the salient properties of the GMM learned from natural images can be derived from a simplified Dead Leaves model which explicitly models occlusion, explaining its surprising success relative to other models."
1408,4152,2012,A lattice filter model of the visual pathway,"Early stages of visual processing are thought to decorrelate, or whiten, the incoming temporally varying signals. Because the typical correlation time of natural stimuli, as well as the extent of temporal receptive fields of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons, is much greater than neuronal time constants, such decorrelation must be done in stages combining contributions of multiple neurons. We propose to model temporal decorrelation in the visual pathway with the lattice filter, a signal processing device for stage-wise decorrelation of temporal signals. The stage-wise architecture of the lattice filter maps naturally onto the visual pathway (photoreceptors -> bipolar cells -> retinal ganglion cells -> LGN) and its filter weights can be learned using Hebbian rules in a stage-wise sequential manner. Moreover, predictions of neural activity from the lattice filter model are consistent with physiological measurements in LGN neurons and fruit fly second-order visual neurons. Therefore, the lattice filter model is a useful abstraction that may help unravel visual system function."
1409,4154,2012,Semantic Kernel Forests from Multiple Taxonomies,"When learning features for complex visual recognition problems, labeled image exemplars alone can be insufficient.  While an \emph{object taxonomy} specifying the categories' semantic relationships could bolster the learning process, not all relationships are relevant to a given visual classification task, nor does a single taxonomy capture all ties that \emph{are} relevant.  In light of these issues, we propose a discriminative feature learning approach that leverages \emph{multiple} hierarchical taxonomies representing different semantic views of the object categories (e.g., for animal classes, one taxonomy could reflect their phylogenic ties, while another could reflect their habitats).  For each taxonomy, we first learn a tree of semantic kernels, where each node has a Mahalanobis kernel optimized to distinguish between the classes in its children nodes.  Then, using the resulting \emph{semantic kernel forest}, we learn class-specific kernel combinations to select only those relationships relevant to recognize each object class.  To learn the weights, we introduce a novel hierarchical regularization term that further exploits the taxonomies' structure.  We demonstrate our method on challenging object recognition datasets, and show that interleaving multiple taxonomic views yields significant accuracy improvements."
1410,4155,2012,Human memory search as a random walk in a semantic network,"The human mind has a remarkable ability to store a vast amount of information in memory, and an even more remarkable ability to retrieve these experiences when needed. Understanding the representations and algorithms that underlie human memory search could potentially be useful in other information retrieval settings, including internet search. Psychological studies have revealed clear regularities in how people search their memory, with clusters of semantically related items tending to be retrieved together. These findings have recently been taken as evidence that human memory search is similar to animals foraging for food in patchy environments, with people making a rational decision to switch away from a cluster of related information as it becomes depleted. We demonstrate that the results that were taken as evidence for this account also emerge from a random walk on a semantic network, much like the random web surfer model used in internet search engines. This offers a simpler and more unified account of how people search their memory, postulating a single process rather than one process for exploring a cluster and one process for switching between clusters."
1411,4156,2012,Tractable Objectives for Robust Policy Optimization,"Robust policy optimization acknowledges that risk-aversion plays a vital role in real-world decision-making. When faced with uncertainty about the effects of actions, the policy that maximizes expected utility over the unknown parameters of the system may also carry with it a risk of intolerably poor performance.  One might prefer to accept lower utility in expectation in order to avoid, or reduce the likelihood of, unacceptable levels of utility under harmful parameter realizations.   In this paper, we take a Bayesian approach to parameter uncertainty, but unlike other methods avoid making any distributional assumptions about the form of this uncertainty.  Instead we focus on identifying optimization objectives for which solutions can be efficiently approximated.  We introduce percentile measures: a very general class of objectives for robust policy optimization, which encompasses most existing approaches, including ones known to be intractable. We then introduce a broad subclass of this family for which robust policies can be approximated efficiently. Finally, we frame these objectives in the context of a two-player, zero-sum, extensive-form game and employ a no-regret algorithm to approximate an optimal policy, with computation only polynomial in the number of states and actions of the MDP."
1412,4158,2012,Multiclass Learning with Simplex Coding,"In this paper we dicuss a novel  framework for multiclass learning,  defined by  a suitable coding/decoding strategy,  namely the simplex coding, that allows to generalize to multiple classes a relaxation approach commonly used in binary classification. In this framework a  relaxation error analysis can be developed avoiding constraints on the considered hypotheses class.  Moreover, we show that in this setting it is possible to derive the first provably consistent  regularized methods with training/tuning complexity which is {\em independent} to the number of classes. Tools from convex analysis are introduced that can be used beyond the scope of this paper."
1413,4159,2012,Globally Convergent Dual MAP LP Relaxation Solvers using Fenchel-Young Margins,"While finding the exact solution for the MAP inference problem is intractable for many real-world tasks, MAP LP relaxations have been shown to be very effective in practice.  However, the most efficient methods that perform block coordinate descent can get stuck in sub-optimal points as  they are not globally convergent. In this work we propose to augment these algorithms with an $\epsilon$-descent approach and present a method to efficiently optimize for a descent direction in the subdifferential using a margin-based extension of the Fenchel-Young duality theorem. Furthermore, the presented approach provides a methodology to construct a primal optimal solution from its dual optimal counterpart. We demonstrate the efficiency of the presented approach on spin glass models and protein interactions problems and show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art solvers."
1414,4160,2012,Fast Variational Inference in the Conjugate Exponential Family,We present a general method for deriving collapsed variational inference algorithms for probabilistic models in the conjugate exponential family. Our method unifies many existing approaches to collapsed variational inference. Our collapsed variational inference leads to a new lower bound on the marginal likelihood. We exploit the information geometry of the bound to derive much faster optimization methods based on conjugate gradients for these models. Our approach is very general and is easily applied to any model where the mean field update equations have been derived. Empirically we show significant speed-ups for probabilistic models optimized using our bound.
1415,4161,2012,Efficient Bayes-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning using Sample-Based Search,"Bayesian model-based reinforcement learning is a formally elegant approach to learning optimal behaviour under model uncertainty, trading off exploration and exploitation in an ideal way. Unfortunately, finding the resulting Bayes-optimal policies is notoriously taxing, since the search space becomes enormous. In this paper we introduce a tractable, sample-based method for approximate Bayes-optimal planning which exploits Monte-Carlo tree search. Our approach outperformed prior Bayesian model-based RL algorithms by a significant margin on several well-known benchmark problems -- because it avoids expensive applications of Bayes rule within the search tree by lazily sampling models from the current beliefs. We illustrate the advantages of our approach by showing it working in an infinite state space domain which is qualitatively out of reach of almost all previous work in Bayesian exploration."
1416,4162,2012,Exponential Concentration for Mutual Information Estimation with Application to Forests,"We prove a new exponential concentration inequality for a plug-in estimator of the Shannon mutual information. Previous results on mutual information estimation only bounded expected error. The advantage of having the exponential inequality is that, combined with the union bound, we can guarantee accurate estimators of the mutual information for many pairs of random variables simultaneously. As an application, we show how to use such a result to optimally estimate the density function and graph of a distribution which is Markov to a forest graph."
1417,4163,2012,Learning to Align from Scratch,"Unsupervised joint alignment of images has been demonstrated to   improve performance on recognition tasks such as face verification.   Such alignment reduces undesired variability due to factors such as   pose, while only requiring weak supervision in the form of poorly   aligned examples.  However, prior work on unsupervised alignment of   complex, real world images has required the careful selection of   feature representation based on hand-crafted image descriptors, in   order to achieve an appropriate, smooth optimization landscape.    In this paper, we instead propose a novel combination of   unsupervised joint alignment with unsupervised feature learning.   Specifically, we incorporate deep learning into the {\em congealing}   alignment framework.  Through deep learning, we obtain features that   can represent the image at differing resolutions based on network   depth, and that are tuned to the statistics of the specific data   being aligned.  In addition, we modify the learning algorithm for   the restricted Boltzmann machine by incorporating a group sparsity   penalty, leading to a topographic organization on the learned   filters and improving subsequent alignment results.    We apply our method to the Labeled Faces in the Wild database   (LFW). Using the aligned images produced by our proposed   unsupervised algorithm, we achieve a significantly higher accuracy   in face verification than obtained using the original face images,   prior work in unsupervised alignment, and prior work in supervised   alignment.  We also match the accuracy for the best available, but   unpublished method."
1418,4165,2012,Dynamical And-Or Graph Learning for Object Shape Modeling and Detection,"This paper studies a novel discriminative part-based model to represent and recognize object shapes with an ?And-Or graph?. We define this model consisting of three layers: the leaf-nodes with collaborative edges for localizing local parts, the or-nodes specifying the switch of leaf-nodes, and the root-node encoding the global verification. A discriminative learning algorithm, extended from the CCCP [23], is proposed to train the model in a dynamical manner: the model structure (e.g., the configuration of the leaf-nodes associated with the or-nodes) is automatically determined with optimizing the multi-layer parameters during the iteration. The advantages of our method are two-fold. (i) The And-Or graph model enables us to handle well large intra-class variance and background clutters for object shape detection from images. (ii) The proposed learning algorithm is able to obtain the And-Or graph representation without requiring elaborate supervision and initialization. We validate the proposed method on several challenging databases (e.g., INRIA-Horse, ETHZ-Shape, and UIUC-People), and it outperforms the state-of-the-arts approaches."
1419,4166,2012,Identification of Recurrent Patterns in the Activation of Brain Networks,"Identifying patterns from the neuroimaging recordings of brain activity  related to the unobservable psychological or mental state of an individual can be treated as a unsupervised pattern recognition problem. The main challenges, however, for such an analysis of fMRI data are: a) defining a physiologically meaningful feature-space for representing the spatial patterns across time; b) dealing with the high-dimensionality of the data; and c) robustness to the various artifacts and confounds in the fMRI time-series.  In this paper, we present a network-aware feature-space to represent the states of a general network, that enables  comparing and clustering such states in a manner that is a) meaningful in terms of the network connectivity structure; b)computationally efficient; c) low-dimensional; and d) relatively robust to structured and random noise artifacts. This feature-space is obtained from a spherical relaxation of the transportation distance metric which measures the cost of transporting ``mass'' over the network to transform one function into another. Through theoretical and empirical assessments, we demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the approximation, especially for large problems.  While the application presented here is for identifying distinct brain activity patterns from fMRI, this feature-space can be applied to the problem of identifying recurring patterns and detecting outliers in measurements on many different types of networks, including sensor, control and social networks."
1420,4167,2012,Scaling MPE Inference for Constrained Continuous Markov Random Fields with Consensus Optimization,"Probabilistic graphical models are powerful tools for analyzing constrained, continuous domains. However, finding most-probable explanations (MPEs) in these models can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we improve the scalability of MPE inference in a class of graphical models with piecewise-linear and piecewise-quadratic dependencies and linear constraints over continuous domains. We derive algorithms based on a consensus-optimization framework and demonstrate their superior performance over state of the art. We show empirically that in a large-scale voter-preference modeling problem our algorithms scale linearly in the number of dependencies and constraints."
1421,4169,2012,A Generative Model for Parts-based Object Segmentation,"The Shape Boltzmann Machine (SBM) has recently been introduced as a state-of-the-art model of foreground/background object shape. We extend the SBM to account for the foreground object's parts. Our model, the Multinomial SBM (MSBM), can capture both local and global statistics of part shapes accurately. We combine the MSBM with an appearance model to form a fully generative model of images of objects. Parts-based image segmentations are obtained simply by performing probabilistic inference in the model. We apply the model to two challenging datasets which exhibit significant shape and appearance variability, and find that it obtains results that are comparable to the state-of-the-art."
1422,4170,2012,A P300 BCI for the Masses: Prior Information Enables Instant Unsupervised Spelling,"The usability of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) based on the P300 speller is severely hindered by the need for long training times and many repetitions of the same stimulus. In this contribution we introduce a set of unsupervised hierarchical probabilistic models that tackle both problems simultaneously by incorporating prior knowledge from two sources: information from other training subjects (through transfer learning) and information about the words being spelled (through language models). We show, that due to this prior knowledge, the performance of the unsupervised models parallels and in some cases even surpasses that of supervised models, while eliminating the tedious training session."
1423,4171,2012,Delay Compensation with Dynamical Synapses,"Time delay is pervasive in neural information processing. To achieve real-time tracking, it is critical to compensate the transmission and processing delays in a neural system. In the present study we show that dynamical synapses with short-term depression can enhance the mobility of a continuous attractor network to the extent that the system tracks time-varying stimuli in a timely manner. The state of the network can either track the instantaneous position of a moving stimulus perfectly (with zero-lag) or lead it with an effectively constant time, in agreement with experiments on the head-direction systems in rodents. The parameter regions for delayed, perfect and anticipative tracking correspond to network states that are static, ready-to-move and spontaneously moving, respectively, demonstrating the strong correlation between tracking performance and the intrinsic dynamics of the network. We also find that when the speed of the stimulus coincides with the natural speed of the network state, the delay becomes effectively independent of the stimulus amplitude."
1424,4172,2012,Learning Manifolds with K-Means and K-Flats,"We study the problem of estimating a manifold from random samples. In particular, we consider piecewise constant and piecewise linear estimators induced by  k-means and k-?ats, and analyze their performance. We extend previous results  for k-means in two separate directions. First, we provide new results for k-means reconstruction on manifolds and, secondly, we prove reconstruction bounds for higher-order approximation (k-?ats), for which no known results were previously available. While the results for k-means are novel, some of the technical tools are well-established in the literature. In the case of k-?ats, both the results and the mathematical tools are  new."
1425,4173,2012,One Permutation Hashing,"While minwise hashing is promising for large-scale learning in massive binary data, the preprocessing cost is prohibitive as it requires applying (e.g.,) $k=500$ permutations on the data. The testing time is also  expensive if a new data point (e.g., a new document or a new image) has not been processed.  In this paper, we develop a simple \textbf{one permutation hashing} scheme to address this important issue. While it is true that the preprocessing step can be parallelized, it comes at the cost of additional hardware and implementation. Also, reducing $k$ permutations to just one  would be much more \textbf{energy-efficient}, which might be an important perspective as minwise hashing is commonly deployed in the search industry. While the theoretical probability analysis is  interesting, our experiments on similarity estimation and   SVM \& logistic regression also confirm the theoretical results."
1426,4174,2012,The variational hierarchical EM algorithm for clustering hidden Markov models,"In this paper, we derive a novel algorithm to cluster  hidden Markov models (HMMs) according to their probability distributions. We propose a variational hierarchical EM algorithm that i) clusters a given collection of HMMs into groups of HMMs that are similar, in terms of the distributions they represent, and ii) characterizes each group by a ``cluster center'', i.e., a novel HMM that is representative for the group. We illustrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm on hierarchical clustering of motion capture sequences as well as on automatic music tagging."
1427,4176,2012,Hierarchical spike coding of sound,"We develop a probabilistic generative model for representing acoustic event structure at multiple scales via a two-stage hierarchy. The first stage consists of a spiking representation which encodes a sound with a sparse set of kernels at different frequencies positioned precisely in time. The coarse time and frequency statistical structure of the first-stage spikes is encoded by a second stage spiking representation, while fine-scale statistical regularities are encoded by recurrent interactions within the first-stage.  When fitted to speech data, the model encodes acoustic features such as harmonic stacks, sweeps, and frequency modulations, that can be composed to represent complex acoustic events. The model is also able to synthesize sounds from the higher-level representation and provides significant improvement over wavelet thresholding techniques on a denoising task."
1428,4177,2012,Volume Regularization for Binary Classification,"We introduce a large-volume box classification for binary   prediction, which maintains a subset of weight vectors, and   specifically axis-aligned boxes. Our learning algorithm seeks for a   box of large volume that contains ``simple'' weight vectors which   most of are accurate on the training set. Two versions of the   learning process are cast as convex optimization problems, and it   is shown how to solve them efficiently.  The formulation yields a   natural PAC-Bayesian performance bound and it is shown to minimize a   quantity directly aligned with it. The algorithm outperforms SVM and   the recently proposed AROW algorithm on a majority of $30$ NLP   datasets and binarized USPS optical character recognition datasets."
1429,4178,2012,Scalable imputation of genetic data with a discrete fragmentation-coagulation process,"We present a Bayesian nonparametric model for genetic sequence data in which a set of genetic sequences is modelled using a Markov model of  partitions. The partitions at consecutive locations in the genome are related by their clusters first splitting and then merging.  Our model can be thought of as a discrete time analogue of continuous time fragmentation-coagulation processes [Teh et al 2011], preserving the important properties of projectivity, exchangeability and reversibility, while being more scalable. We apply this model to the problem of genotype imputation, showing improved computational efficiency while maintaining the same accuracies as in [Teh et al 2011]."
1430,4179,2012,"Optimal Neural Tuning Curves for Arbitrary Stimulus Distributions: Discrimax, Infomax and Minimum ","In this work we study how the stimulus distribution influences the optimal coding of an individual neuron. Closed-form solutions to the optimal sigmoidal tuning curve are provided for a neuron obeying Poisson statistics under a given stimulus distribution. We consider a variety of optimality criteria, including maximizing discriminability, maximizing mutual information and minimizing estimation error under a general $L_p$ norm.  We generalize the Cramer-Rao lower bound and show how the $L_p$ loss can be written as a functional of the Fisher Information in the asymptotic limit, by proving the moment convergence of certain functions of Poisson random variables.  In this manner, we show how the optimal tuning curve depends upon the loss function, and the equivalence of maximizing mutual information with minimizing $L_p$ loss in the limit as $p$ goes to zero."
1431,4180,2012,Factorial LDA: Sparse Multi-Dimensional Text Models,"Multi-dimensional latent variable models can capture the many latent factors in a text corpus, such as topic, author perspective and sentiment. We introduce factorial LDA, a multi-dimensional latent variable model in which a document is influenced by K different factors, and each word token depends on a K-dimensional vector of latent variables. Our model incorporates structured word priors and learns a sparse product of factors. Experiments on research abstracts show that our model can learn latent factors such as research topic, scientific discipline, and focus (e.g. methods vs. applications.) Our modeling improvements reduce test perplexity and improve human interpretability of the discovered factors."
1432,4181,2012,Scalable nonconvex inexact proximal splitting,"We study large-scale, nonsmooth, nonconconvex optimization problems. In particular, we focus on nonconvex problems with \emph{composite} objectives. This class of problems includes the extensively studied convex, composite objective problems as a special case. To tackle composite nonconvex problems, we introduce a powerful new framework based on asymptotically \emph{nonvanishing} errors, avoiding the common convenient assumption of eventually vanishing errors. Within our framework we derive both batch and incremental nonconvex proximal splitting algorithms. To our knowledge, our framework is first to develop and analyze incremental \emph{nonconvex} proximal-splitting algorithms, even if we disregard the ability to handle nonvanishing errors. We illustrate our theoretical framework by showing how it applies to difficult large-scale, nonsmooth, and nonconvex problems."
1433,4182,2012,The Time-Marginalized Coalescent Prior for Hierarchical Clustering,"We introduce a new prior for use in Nonparametric Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering. The prior is constructed by marginalizing out the time information of Kingman?s coalescent, providing a prior over tree structures which we call the Time-Marginalized Coalescent (TMC). This allows for models which factorize the tree structure and times, providing two benefits: more flexible priors may be constructed and more efficient Gibbs type inference can be used. We demonstrate this on an example model for density estimation and show the TMC achieves competitive experimental results."
1434,4183,2012,Discriminatively Trained Sparse Code Gradients for Contour Detection,"Finding contours in natural images is a fundamental problem that serves as the basis of many tasks such as image segmentation and object recognition. At the core of contour detection technologies are a set of hand-designed gradient features, used by most existing approaches including the state-of-the-art Global Pb (gPb) operator.  In this work, we show that contour detection accuracy can be significantly improved by computing Sparse Code Gradients (SCG), which measure contrast using patch representations automatically learned through sparse coding.  We use K-SVD and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit for efficient dictionary learning and encoding, and use multi-scale pooling and power transforms to code oriented local neighborhoods before computing gradients and applying linear SVM. By extracting rich representations from pixels and avoiding collapsing them prematurely, Sparse Code Gradients effectively learn how to measure local contrasts and find contours. We improve the F-measure metric on the BSDS500 benchmark to 0.74 (up from 0.71 of gPb contours).  Moreover, our learning approach can easily adapt to novel sensor data such as Kinect-style RGB-D cameras: Sparse Code Gradients on depth images and surface normals lead to promising contour detection using depth and depth+color, as verified on the NYU Depth Dataset.  Our work combines the concept of oriented gradients with sparse representation and opens up future possibilities for learning contour detection and segmentation."
1435,4184,2012,Joint Modeling of a Matrix with Associated Text via Latent Binary Features,"A new methodology is developed for joint analysis of a matrix and accompanying documents, with the documents associated with the matrix rows/columns. The documents are modeled with a focused topic model, inferring latent binary features (topics) for each document. A new matrix decomposition is developed, with latent binary features associated with the rows/columns, and with imposition of a low-rank constraint. The matrix decomposition and topic model are coupled by sharing the latent binary feature vectors associated with each. The model is applied to roll-call data, with the associated documents defined by the legislation. State-of-the-art results are manifested for prediction of votes on a new piece of legislation, based only on the observed text legislation. The coupling of the text and legislation is also demonstrated to yield insight into the properties of the matrix decomposition for roll-call data."
1436,4185,2012,Proper losses for learning from partial labels,"This paper discusses the problem of calibrating posterior class probabilities from partially labelled data. Each instance is assumed to be labelled as belonging to one of several candidate categories, at most one of them being true. We generalize the concept of proper loss to this scenario, establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a loss function to be proper, and we show a direct procedure to construct a proper loss for partial labels from a conventional proper loss. The problem can be characterized by the mixing probability matrix relating the true class of the data and the observed labels. An interesting result is that the full knowledge of this matrix is not required, and losses can be constructed that are proper in a subset of the probability simplex."
1437,4187,2012,Coupling Nonparametric Mixtures via Latent Dirichlet Processes,"Mixture distributions are often used to model complex data. In this paper, we develop a new method that jointly estimates mixture models over multiple data sets by exploiting the statistical dependencies between them. Specifically, we introduce a set of latent Dirichlet processes as sources of component models (atoms), and for each data set, we construct a nonparametric mixture model by combining sub-sampled versions of the latent DPs. Each mixture model may acquire atoms from different latent DPs, while each atom may be shared by multiple mixtures. This multi-to-multi association distinguishes the proposed method from prior constructions that rely on tree or chain structures, allowing mixture models to be coupled more flexibly. In addition, we derive a sampling algorithm that jointly infers the model parameters and present experiments on both document analysis and image modeling."
1438,4188,2012,Projection Retrieval for Classification,"In many applications classification systems often require in the loop human intervention. In such cases the decision process must be transparent and comprehensible simultaneously requiring minimal assumptions on the underlying data distribution. To tackle this problem, we formulate it as an axis-alligned subspacefinding task under the assumption that query specific information dictates the complementary use of the subspaces. We develop a regression-based approach called RECIP that efficiently solves this problem by finding projections that minimize a nonparametric conditional entropy estimator. Experiments show that the method is accurate in identifying the informative projections of the dataset, picking the correct ones to classify query points and facilitates visual evaluation by users."
1439,4189,2012,Fusion with Diffusion for Robust Visual Tracking,"A weighted graph is used as an underlying structure of many algorithms like semi-supervised learning and spectral clustering. The edge weights are usually deter-mined by a single similarity measure, but it often hard if not impossible to capture all relevant aspects of similarity when using a single similarity measure. In par-ticular, in the case of visual object matching it is beneficial to integrate different similarity measures that focus on different visual representations. In this paper, a novel approach to integrate multiple similarity measures is pro-posed. First pairs of similarity measures are combined with a diffusion process on their tensor product graph (TPG). Hence the diffused similarity of each pair of ob-jects becomes a function of joint diffusion of the two original similarities, which in turn depends on the neighborhood structure of the TPG. We call this process Fusion with Diffusion (FD). However, a higher order graph like the TPG usually means significant increase in time complexity. This is not the case in the proposed approach. A key feature of our approach is that the time complexity of the dif-fusion on the TPG is the same as the diffusion process on each of the original graphs, Moreover, it is not necessary to explicitly construct the TPG in our frame-work. Finally all diffused pairs of similarity measures are combined as a weighted sum. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach on the task of visual tracking, where different aspects of the appearance similarity between the target object in frame t and target object candidates in frame t+1 are integrated. The obtained method is tested on several challenge video sequences and the experimental results show that it outperforms state-of-the-art tracking methods."
1440,4190,2012,Co-Regularized Hashing for Multimodal Data,"Hashing-based methods provide a very promising approach to large-scale similarity search.  To obtain compact hash codes, a recent trend seeks to learn the hash functions from data automatically.  In this paper, we study hash function learning in the context of multimodal data.  We propose a novel multimodal hash function learning method, called Co-Regularized Hashing (CRH), based on a boosted co-regularization framework.  The hash functions for each bit of the hash codes are learned by solving DC (difference of convex functions) programs, while the learning for multiple bits proceeds via a boosting procedure so that the bias introduced by the hash functions can be sequentially minimized.  We empirically compare CRH with two state-of-the-art multimodal hash function learning methods on two publicly available data sets."
1441,4191,2012,Max-Margin Structured Output Regression for Spatio-Temporal Action Localization,"Structured output learning has been successfully applied to object localization, where the mapping between an image and an object bounding box can be well captured. Its extension to action localization in videos, however, is much more challenging, because one needs to predict the locations of the action patterns both spatially and temporally, i.e., identifying a sequence of bounding boxes that track the action in video. The problem becomes intractable due to the exponentially large size of the structured video space where actions could occur. We propose a novel structured learning approach for spatio-temporal action localization. The mapping between a video and a spatio-temporal action trajectory is learned. The intractable inference and learning problems are addressed by leveraging an efficient Max-Path search method, thus makes it feasible to optimize the model over the whole structured space. Experiments on two challenging benchmark datasets show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."
1442,4192,2012,Dip-means: an incremental clustering method for estimating the number of clusters,"Learning the number of clusters is a key problem in data clustering. We present dip-means, a novel robust incremental method to learn the number of data clusters that may be used as a wrapper around any iterative clustering algorithm of the k-means family. In contrast to many popular methods which make assumptions about the underlying cluster distributions, dip-means only assumes a fundamental cluster property: each cluster to admit a unimodal distribution. The proposed algorithm considers each cluster member as a ''viewer'' and applies a univariate statistic hypothesis test for unimodality (dip-test) on the distribution of the distances between the viewer and the cluster members. Two important advantages are: i) the unimodality test is applied on univariate distance vectors, ii) it can be directly applied with kernel-based methods, since only the pairwise distances are involved in the computations. Experimental results on artificial and real datasets indicate the effectiveness of our method and its superiority over analogous approaches."
1443,4193,2012,Wavelet based multi-scale shape features on arbitrary surfaces for cortical thickness discrimination,"Hypothesis testing on signals de?ned on surfaces (such as the cortical surface) is a fundamental component of a variety of studies in Neuroscience. The goal here is to identify regions that exhibit changes as a function of the clinical condition under study. As the clinical questions of interest move towards identifying very early signs of diseases, the corresponding statistical differences at the group level invariably become weaker and increasingly hard to identify. Indeed, after a multiple comparisons correction is adopted (to account for correlated statistical tests over all surface points), very few regions may survive. In contrast to hypothesis tests on point-wise measurements, in this paper, we make the case for performing statistical analysis on multi-scale shape descriptors that characterize the local topological context of the signal around each surface vertex. Our descriptors are based on recent results from harmonic analysis, that show how wavelet theory extends to non-Euclidean settings (i.e., irregular weighted graphs). We provide strong evidence that these descriptors successfully pick up group-wise differences, where traditional methods either fail or yield unsatisfactory results. Other than this primary application, we show how the framework allows performing cortical surface smoothing in the native space without mappint to a unit sphere."
1444,4194,2012,Stochastic Gradient Descent with Only One Projection,"Although many variants of stochastic gradient descent have been proposed for large-scale convex optimization, most of them require projecting the solution at {\it each} iteration to ensure that the obtained solution stays within the feasible domain. For complex domains (e.g., positive semidefinite cone), the projection step can be computationally expensive, making stochastic gradient descent unattractive for large-scale optimization problems. We address this limitation by developing a novel stochastic gradient descent algorithm that does not need intermediate projections. Instead, only one projection at the last iteration is needed to obtain a feasible solution in the given domain. Our theoretical analysis shows that with a high probability, the proposed algorithms achieve an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate for general convex optimization, and an $O(\ln T/T)$  rate for  strongly convex optimization under mild conditions about the domain and the objective function."
1445,4195,2012,Ensemble weighted kernel estimators for multivariate entropy estimation,"The problem of estimation of entropy functionals of probability densities has received much attention in the information theory, machine learning and statistics communities. Kernel density plug-in estimators are simple, easy to implement and widely used for estimation of entropy. However, kernel plug-in estimators suffer from the curse of dimensionality, wherein the MSE rate of convergence is glacially slow - of order  $O(T^{-{\gamma}/{d}})$, where $T$ is the number of samples, and $\gamma>0$ is a rate parameter. In this paper, it is shown that for sufficiently smooth densities, an ensemble of kernel plug-in estimators can be combined via a weighted convex combination, such that the resulting weighted estimator has a superior parametric MSE rate of convergence of order $O(T^{-1})$. Furthermore, it is shown that these optimal weights can be determined by solving a convex optimization problem which does not require training data or knowledge of the underlying density, and therefore can be performed offline. This novel result is remarkable in that, while each of the individual kernel plug-in estimators belonging to the ensemble suffer from the curse of dimensionality, by appropriate ensemble averaging we can achieve parametric convergence rates."
1446,4196,2012,Visual Recognition using Embedded Feature Selection for Curvature Self-Similarity,"Category-level object detection has a crucial need for informative object representations. This demand has led to feature descriptors of ever increasing dimensionality  like co-occurrence statistics and self-similarity. In this paper we propose a new object representation based on curvature self-similarity that goes beyond the currently popular  approximation of objects using straight lines. However, like all descriptors using second order statistics, ours also exhibits a high dimensionality. Although improving discriminability,  the high dimensionality becomes a critical issue due to lack of generalization ability and curse of dimensionality. Given only a limited amount of training data, even sophisticated  learning algorithms such as the popular kernel methods are not able to suppress noisy or superfluous dimensions of such high-dimensional data. Consequently, there is a natural need for  feature selection when using present-day informative features and, particularly, curvature self-similarity. We therefore suggest an embedded feature selection method for SVMs that  reduces complexity and improves generalization capability of object models. By successfully integrating the proposed curvature self-similarity representation together with the embedded  feature selection in a widely used state-of-the-art object detection framework we show the general pertinence of the approach."
1447,4199,2012,On the Use of Non-Stationary Policies for Stationary Infinite-Horizon Markov Decision Processes,"We consider infinite-horizon stationary $\gamma$-discounted Markov   Decision Processes, for which it is known that there exists a   stationary optimal policy. Using Value and Policy Iteration with   some error $\epsilon$ at each iteration, it is well-known that one   can compute stationary policies that are $\frac{2\gamma{(1-\gamma)^2}\epsilon$-optimal. After arguing that this   guarantee is tight, we develop variations of Value and Policy   Iteration for computing non-stationary policies that can be up to   $\frac{2\gamma}{1-\gamma}\epsilon$-optimal, which constitutes a significant   improvement in the usual situation when $\gamma$ is close to   $1$. Surprisingly, this shows that the problem of ``computing near-optimal non-stationary policies'' is much simpler than that   of ``computing near-optimal stationary policies''."
1448,4200,2012,Forging The Graphs: A Low Rank and Positive Semidefinite Graph Learning Approach,"In many graph-based machine learning and data mining approaches, the quality of the graph is critical. However, in real-world applications, especially in semi-supervised learning and unsupervised learning, the evaluation of the quality of a graph is often expensive and sometimes even impossible, due the cost or the unavailability of ground truth. In this paper, we proposed a robust approach with convex optimization to ``forge'' a graph: with an input of a graph, to learn a graph with higher quality. Our major concern is that an ideal graph shall satisfy all the following constraints: non-negative, symmetric, low rank, and positive semidefinite. We develop a graph learning algorithm by solving a convex optimization problem and further develop an efficient optimization to obtain global optimal solutions with theoretical guarantees. With only one non-sensitive parameter, our method is shown by experimental results to be robust and achieve higher accuracy in semi-supervised learning and clustering under various settings. As a preprocessing of graphs, our method has a wide range of potential applications machine learning and data mining."
1449,4201,2012,Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation with Non-Parametric Copulas,"A new framework based on the theory of copulas is proposed to address semi-supervised domain adaptation problems. The presented method factorizes any multivariate density into a product of marginal distributions and bivariate copula functions. Therefore, changes in each of these factors can be detected and corrected to adapt a density model across different learning domains. Importantly, we introduce a novel vine copula model, which allows for this factorization in a non-parametric manner. Experimental results on regression problems with real-world data illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach when compared to state-of-the-art techniques."
1450,4202,2012,Cost-Sensitive Exploration in Bayesian Reinforcement Learning,"In this paper, we consider Bayesian reinforcement learning (BRL) where actions incur costs in addition to rewards, and thus exploration has to be constrained in terms of the expected total cost while learning to maximize the expected long-term total reward. In order to formalize cost-sensitive exploration, we use the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) as the model of the environment, in which we can naturally encode exploration requirements using the cost function. We extend BEETLE, a model-based BRL method, for learning in the environment with cost constraints. We demonstrate the cost-sensitive exploration behaviour in a number of simulated problems."
1451,4203,2012,How Prior Probability Influences Decision Making: A Unifying Probabilistic Model,"How does the brain combine prior knowledge with sensory evidence when making decisions under uncertainty? Two competing descriptive models have been proposed based on experimental data.  The first posits an additive offset to a decision variable, implying a static effect of the prior. However, this model is inconsistent with recent data from a motion discrimination task involving temporal integration of uncertain sensory evidence. To explain this data, a second model has been proposed which assumes a time-varying influence of the prior. Here we present a normative model of decision making that incorporates prior knowledge in a principled way.  We show that the additive offset model and the time-varying prior model emerge naturally when decision making is viewed within the framework of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs).  Decision making in the model reduces to (1) computing beliefs given observations and prior information in a Bayesian manner, and (2) selecting actions based on these beliefs to maximize the  expected sum of future rewards. We show that the model can explain both  data previously explained using the additive offset model as well as more  recent data on the time-varying influence of prior knowledge on decision making."
1452,4204,2012,A Bayesian Approach for Policy Learning from Trajectory Preference Queries,"We consider the problem of learning control policies via trajectory preference queries to an expert. In particular, the learning agent can present an expert with short runs of a pair of policies originating from the same state and the expert then indicates the preferred trajectory. The agent's goal is to elicit a latent target policy from the expert with as few queries as possible. To tackle this problem we propose a novel Bayesian model of the querying process and introduce two methods that exploit this model to actively select expert queries. Experimental results on four benchmark problems indicate that our model can effectively learn policies from trajectory preference queries and that active query selection can be substantially more efficient than random selection."
1453,4205,2012,The Perturbed Variation,"We introduce a new discrepancy score between two distributions that gives an indication on their \emph{similarity}. While much research has been done to determine if two samples come from exactly the same distribution, much less research considered the problem of determining if two finite samples come from similar distributions. The new score gives an intuitive interpretation of similarity;  it optimally perturbs the distributions so that they best fit each other. The score is defined between distributions, and can be efficiently estimated from samples. We provide convergence bounds of the estimated score, and develop hypothesis testing procedures that test if two data sets come from similar distributions. The statistical power of this procedures is presented in simulations. We also compare the score's capacity to detect similarity with that of other known measures on real data."
1454,4206,2012,Multi-task Vector Field Learning,"Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to improve generalization performance by learning multiple related tasks simultaneously and identifying the shared information among tasks. Most of existing MTL methods focus on learning linear models under the supervised setting. We propose a novel semi-supervised and nonlinear approach for MTL using vector fields. A vector field is a smooth mapping from the manifold to the tangent spaces which can be viewed as a directional derivative of functions on the manifold. We argue that vector fields provide a natural way to exploit the geometric structure of data as well as the shared differential structure of tasks, both are crucial for semi-supervised multi-task learning. In this paper, we develop multi-task vector field learning (MTVFL) which learns the prediction functions and the vector fields simultaneously. MTVFL has the following key properties: (1) the vector fields we learned are close to the gradient fields of the prediction functions; (2) within each task, the vector field is required to be as parallel as possible which is expected to span a low dimensional subspace; (3) the vector fields from all tasks share a low dimensional subspace. We formalize our idea in a regularization framework and also provide a convex relaxation method to solve the original non-convex problem. The experimental results on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach."
1455,4207,2012,Hamming Distance Metric Learning,"Motivated by large-scale multimedia applications we propose to learn mappings from high-dimensional data to binary codes that preserve semantic similarity. Binary codes are well suited to large-scale applications as they are storage efficient and permit exact sub-linear kNN search. The framework is applicable to broad families of mappings, and uses a flexible form of triplet ranking loss. We overcome discontinuous optimization of the discrete mappings by minimizing a piecewise-smooth upper bound on empirical loss, inspired by latent structural SVMs.  We develop a new loss-augmented inference algorithm that is quadratic in the code length.  We show strong retrieval performance on CIFAR-10 and MNIST, with promising classification results using no more than kNN on the binary codes."
1456,4211,2012,Label Ranking with Partial Abstention based on Thresholded Probabilistic Models,"Several machine learning methods allow for abstaining from uncertain predictions. While being common for settings like conventional classification, abstention has been studied much less in learning to rank. We address abstention for the label ranking setting, allowing the learner to declare certain pairs of labels as being incomparable and, thus, to predict partial instead of total orders. In our method, such predictions are produced via thresholding the probabilities of pairwise preferences between labels, as induced by a predicted probability distribution on the set of all rankings. We formally analyze this approach for the Mallows and the Plackett-Luce model, showing that it produces proper partial orders as predictions and characterizing the expressiveness of the induced class of partial orders. These theoretical results are complemented by experiments demonstrating the practical usefulness of the approach."
1457,4212,2012,Action-Model Based Multi-agent Plan Recognition,"Multi-Agent Plan Recognition (MAPR) aims to recognize dynamic team structures and team behaviors from the observed team traces (activity sequences) of a set of intelligent agents. Previous MAPR approaches required a library of team activity sequences (team plans) be given as input. However, collecting a library of team plans to ensure adequate coverage is often difficult and costly. In this paper, we relax this constraint, so that team plans are not required to be provided beforehand. We assume instead that a set of action models are available. Such models are often already created to describe domain physics; i.e., the  preconditions and effects of effects actions. We propose a novel approach for recognizing multi-agent team plans based on such action models rather than libraries of team plans. We encode the resulting MAPR problem as a \emph{satisfiability problem} and solve the problem using a state-of-the-art weighted MAX-SAT solver. Our approach also allows for incompleteness in the observed plan traces. Our empirical studies demonstrate that our algorithm is both effective and efficient in comparison to state-of-the-art MAPR methods based on plan libraries."
1458,4213,2012,Neurally Plausible Reinforcement Learning of Working Memory Tasks,"A key function of brains is undoubtedly the abstraction and maintenance of information from the environment for later use. Neurons in association cortex play an important role in this process: during learning these neurons become tuned to relevant features and represent the information that is required later as a persistent elevation of their activity. It is however not well known how these neurons acquire their task-relevant tuning. Here we introduce a biologically plausible learning scheme that explains how neurons become selective for relevant information when animals learn by trial and error. We propose that the action selection stage feeds back attentional signals to earlier processing levels. These feedback signals interact with feedforward signals to form synaptic tags at those connections that are responsible for the stimulus-response mapping. A globally released neuromodulatory signal interacts with these tagged synapses to determine the sign and strength of plasticity. The learning scheme is generic because it can train networks in different tasks, simply by varying inputs and rewards. It explains how neurons in association cortex learn to (1) temporarily store task-relevant information in non-linear stimulus-response mapping tasks and (2) learn to optimally integrate probabilistic evidence for perceptual decision making."
1459,4214,2012,Learning visual motion in recurrent neural networks,"We present a dynamic nonlinear generative model for visual motion based on a latent representation of binary-gated Gaussian variables. Trained on sequences of images, the model learns to represent different movement directions in different variables. We use an online approximate-inference scheme that can be mapped to the dynamics of networks of neurons. Probed with drifting grating stimuli and moving bars of light, neurons in the model show patterns of responses analogous to those of direction-selective simple cells in primary visual cortex. Most model neurons also show speed tuning and respond equally well to a range of motion directions and speeds aligned to the constraint line of their respective preferred speed. We show how these computations are enabled by a specific pattern of recurrent connections learned by the model."
1460,4215,2012,Weighted Likelihood Policy Search with Model Selection,"Reinforcement learning (RL) methods based on direct policy search (DPS) have been actively discussed to achieve an efficient approach to complicated Markov decision processes (MDPs). Although they have brought much progress in practical applications of RL, there still remains an unsolved problem in DPS related to model  selection for the policy. In this paper, we propose a novel DPS method, {\it  weighted likelihood policy search (WLPS)}, where a policy is efficiently learned through the weighted likelihood estimation. WLPS naturally connects DPS to the statistical inference problem and thus various sophisticated techniques in statistics can be applied to DPS problems directly. Hence, by following the idea of the {\it information criterion}, we develop a new measurement for model comparison in DPS based on the weighted log-likelihood."
1461,4216,2012,Trajectory-Based Short-Sighted Probabilistic Planning,"Probabilistic planning captures the uncertainty of plan execution by probabilistically modeling the effects of actions in the environment, and therefore the probability of reaching different states from a given state and action. In order to compute a solution for a probabilistic planning problem, planners need to manage the uncertainty associated with the different paths from the initial state to a goal state. Several approaches to manage uncertainty were proposed, e.g., consider all paths at once, perform determinization of actions, and sampling. In this paper, we introduce trajectory-based short-sighted Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (SSPs), a novel approach to manage uncertainty for probabilistic planning problems in which states reachable with low probability are substituted by artificial goals that heuristically estimate their cost to reach a goal state. We also extend the theoretical results of Short-Sighted Probabilistic Planner (SSiPP) [ref] by proving that SSiPP always finishes and is asymptotically optimal under sufficient conditions on the structure of short-sighted SSPs.  We empirically compare SSiPP using trajectory-based short-sighted SSPs with the winners of the previous probabilistic planning competitions and other state-of-the-art planners in the triangle tireworld problems. Trajectory-based SSiPP outperforms all the competitors and is the only planner able to scale up to problem number 60, a problem in which the optimal solution contains approximately $10^{70}$ states."
1462,4217,2012,Efficient high dimensional maximum entropy modeling via symmetric partition functions,"The application of the maximum entropy principle to sequence   modeling has been popularized by methods such as Conditional Random   Fields (CRFs).  However, these approaches are generally limited to   modeling paths in discrete spaces of low dimensionality.  We   consider the problem of modeling distributions over paths in   continuous spaces of high dimensionality---a problem for which   inference is generally intractable.  Our main contribution is to   show that maximum entropy modeling of high-dimensional, continuous   paths is tractable as long as the constrained features    possess a certain kind of low dimensional structure.   In this case, we show that the associated {\em partition function} is   symmetric and that this symmetry can be exploited to compute the   partition function efficiently in a compressed form.  Empirical   results are given showing an application of our method to maximum   entropy modeling of high dimensional human motion capture data."
1463,4218,2012,Parametric Local Metric Learning for Nearest Neighbor Classification,"We study the problem of learning local metrics for nearest neighbor classification. Most previous works on local metric learning learn a number of local unrelated metrics. While this ''independence'' approach delivers an increased flexibility its downside is the considerable risk of overfitting. We present a new parametric local metric learning method in which we learn a smooth metric matrix function over the data manifold. Using an approximation error bound of the metric matrix function we learn local metrics as linear combinations of basis metrics defined on anchor points over different regions of the instance space.  We constrain the metric matrix function by imposing on the linear combinations manifold regularization which makes the learned metric matrix function vary smoothly along the geodesics of the data manifold. Our metric learning method has excellent performance both in terms of predictive power and scalability. We experimented with several large-scale classification problems, tens of thousands of instances, and compared it with several state of the art metric learning methods, both global and local, as well as to SVM with automatic kernel selection, all of which it outperforms in a significant manner."
1464,4219,2012,MAP Inference in Chains using Column Generation,"Linear chains and trees are basic building blocks in many applications of graphical models.  Although exact inference in these models can be performed by dynamic programming, this computation can still be prohibitively expensive with non-trivial target variable domain sizes due to the quadratic dependence on this size.  Standard message-passing algorithms for these problems are inefficient because they compute scores on hypotheses for which there is strong negative local evidence.  For this reason there has been significant previous interest in beam search and its variants; however, these methods provide only approximate inference.  This paper presents new efficient exact inference algorithms based on the combination of it column generation and pre-computed bounds on the model's cost structure.  Improving worst-case performance is impossible. However, our method substantially speeds real-world, typical-case inference in chains and trees.  Experiments show our method to be twice as fast as exact Viterbi for Wall Street Journal part-of-speech tagging and over thirteen times faster for a joint part-of-speed and named-entity-recognition task.  Our algorithm is also extendable to new techniques for approximate inference, to faster two-best inference, and new opportunities for connections between inference and learning."
1465,4221,2012,Active Learning of Multi-Index Function Models,"We consider the problem of actively learning \textit{multi-index} functions of the form $f(\vecx) = g(\matA\vecx)= \sum_{i=1}^k g_i(\veca_i^T\vecx)$ from point evaluations of $f$. We assume that the function $f$ is defined on an $\ell_2$-ball in $\Real^d$, $g$ is twice continuously differentiable almost everywhere, and $\matA \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times d}$ is a rank $k$ matrix, where $k \ll d$.  We propose a randomized, active sampling scheme for estimating such functions with uniform approximation guarantees. Our theoretical developments leverage recent techniques from low rank matrix recovery, which enables us to derive an estimator of the function $f$ along with sample complexity bounds. We also characterize the noise robustness of the scheme, and provide empirical evidence that the high-dimensional scaling of our sample complexity bounds are quite accurate."
1466,4222,2012,On Multilabel Classification and Ranking with Partial Feedback,"We present a novel multilabel/ranking algorithm working in partial information settings. The algorithm is based on 2nd-order descent methods, and relies on upper-confidence bounds to trade-off exploration and exploitation.  We analyze this algorithm in a partial adversarial setting, where covariates can be adversarial, but multilabel probabilities are ruled by (generalized) linear models. We show $O(T^{1/2}\log T)$ regret bounds, which improve in several ways on the existing results. We test the effectiveness of our upper-confidence scheme by contrasting against full-information baselines on real-world multilabel datasets, often obtaining comparable performance."
1467,4224,2012,Calibrated Elastic Regularization in Matrix Completion,"This paper concerns the problem of matrix completion, which is to estimate a matrix from observations in a small subset of indices. We propose a calibrated spectrum elastic net method with a sum of the nuclear and Frobenius penalties and develop an iterative algorithm to solve the convex minimization problem. The iterative algorithm alternates between imputing the missing entries in the incomplete matrix by the current guess and estimating the matrix by a scaled soft-thresholding singular value decomposition of the imputed matrix until the resulting matrix converges. A calibration step follows to correct the bias caused by the Frobenius penalty. Under proper coherence conditions and for suitable penalties levels, we prove that the proposed estimator achieves an error bound of nearly optimal order and in proportion to the noise level. This provides a unified analysis of the noisy and noiseless matrix completion problems. Simulation results are presented to compare our proposal with previous ones."
1468,4225,2012,ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.3 million high-resolution images in the LSVRC-2010 ImageNet training set into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 39.7\% and 18.9\% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art results. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 500,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and two globally connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of convolutional nets. To reduce overfitting in the globally connected layers we employed a new regularization method that proved to be very effective."
1469,4226,2012,Learning from Distributions via Support Measure Machines,"This paper presents a kernel-based discriminative learning framework on probability measures. Rather than relying on large collections of vectorial training examples, our framework learns using a collection of probability distributions that have been constructed to meaningfully represent training data. By representing these probability distributions as mean embeddings in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), we are able to apply many standard kernel-based learning techniques in straightforward fashion. To accomplish this, we construct a generalization of the support vector machine (SVM) called a support measure machine (SMM). Our analyses of SMMs provides several insights into their relationship to traditional SVMs. Based on such insights, we propose a flexible SVM (Flex-SVM) that places different kernel functions on each training example. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework."
1470,4227,2012,Bayesian Nonparametric Modeling of Suicide Attempts,"The National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) database contains a large amount of information, regarding the way of life, medical conditions, depression, etc., of a representative sample of the U.S. population. In the present paper, we are interested in seeking the hidden causes behind the suicide attempts, for which we propose to model the subjects using a nonparametric latent model based on the Indian Buffet Process (IBP). Due to the nature of the data, we need to adapt the observation model for discrete random variables. We propose a generative model in which the observations are drawn from a multinomial-logit distribution given the IBP matrix. The implementation of an efficient Gibbs sampler is accomplished using the Laplace approximation, which allows us to integrate out the weighting factors of the  multinomial-logit likelihood model. Finally, the experiments over the NESARC database show that our model properly captures some of the hidden causes that model suicide attempts."
1471,4228,2012,Learning about Canonical Views from Internet Image Collections,"Although human object recognition is supposedly robust to viewpoint, much research on human perception indicates that there is a preferred or ?canonical? view of objects. This phenomenon was discovered more than 30 years ago but the canonical view of only a small number of categories has been validated experimentally. Moreover, the explanation for why humans prefer the canonical view over other views remains elusive. In this paper we ask: Can we use Internet image collections to learn more about canonical views? We start by manually finding the most common view in the results returned by Internet search engines when queried with the objects used in psychophysical experiments. Our results clearly show that the most likely view in the search engine corresponds to the same view preferred by human subjects in experiments. We also present a simple method to find the most likely view in an image collection and apply it to hundreds of categories. Using the new data we have collected we present strong evidence against the two most prominent formal theories of canonical views and provide novel constraints for new theories."
1472,4230,2012,Collaborative Ranking With 17 Parameters,"The primary application of collaborate filtering (CF) is to recommend a small set of items to a user, which entails ranking. Most approaches, however, formulate the CF problem as rating prediction, overlooking the ranking perspective. In this work we present a method for collaborative ranking that leverages the strengths of the two main CF approaches, neighborhood- and model-based. Our novel method is highly efficient, with only seventeen parameters to optimize and a single hyperparameter to tune, and beats the state-of-the-art collaborative ranking methods. We also show that parameters learned on one dataset yield excellent results on a very different dataset, without any retraining."
1473,4232,2012,Learning Invariant Representations of Molecules for Atomization Energy Prediction,"The accurate prediction of molecular energetics in chemical compound space is a crucial ingredient for rational compound design.  The inherently graph-like, non-vectorial nature of molecular data gives rise to a unique and difficult machine learning problem. In this paper, we adopt a learning-from-scratch approach where quantum-mechanical molecular energies are predicted directly from the raw molecular geometry. The study suggests a benefit from setting flexible priors and enforcing invariance stochastically rather than structurally. Our results improve the state-of-the-art by a factor of almost three, bringing statistical methods one step closer to the holy grail of ''chemical accuracy''."
1474,4233,2012,Angular Quantization-based Binary Codes for Fast Similarity Search,"This paper focuses on the problem of learning binary embeddings for efficient retrieval of high-dimensional non-negative data. Such data typically arises in a large number of vision and text applications where counts or frequencies are used as features.  Also, cosine distance is commonly used as a measure of dissimilarity between such vectors. In this work, we introduce a novel spherical quantization scheme to generate binary embedding of such data and analyze its properties. The number of quantization landmarks in this scheme grows exponentially with data dimensionality resulting in low-distortion quantization.  We propose a very efficient method for computing the binary embedding using such large number of landmarks. Further, a linear transformation is learned to minimize the quantization error by adapting the method to the input data resulting in improved embedding.  Experiments on image and text retrieval applications show superior performance of the proposed method over other existing state-of-the-art methods."
1475,4234,2012,Training sparse natural image models with a fast Gibbs sampler of an extended state space,"We present a new learning strategy based on an efficient blocked Gibbs sampler for sparse overcomplete linear models. Particular emphasis is placed on statistical image modeling, where overcomplete models have played an important role in discovering sparse representations. Our Gibbs sampler is faster than general purpose sampling schemes while also requiring no tuning as it is free of parameters. Using the Gibbs sampler and a persistent variant of expectation maximization, we are able to extract highly sparse distributions over latent sources from data. When applied to natural images, our algorithm learns source distributions which resemble spike-and-slab distributions. We evaluate the likelihood and quantitatively compare the performance of the overcomplete linear model to its complete counterpart as well as a product of experts model, which represents another overcomplete generalization of the complete linear model. In contrast to previous claims, we find that overcomplete representations lead to significant improvements, but that the overcomplete linear model still underperforms other models."
1476,4235,2012,Learning with Partially Absorbing Random Walks,"We propose a novel stochastic process that is with probability $\alpha_i$ being absorbed at current state $i$, and with probability $1-\alpha_i$ follows a random edge out of it. We analyze its properties and show its potential for exploring graph structures. We prove that under proper absorption rates, a random walk starting from a set $\mathcal{S}$ of low conductance will be mostly absorbed in $\mathcal{S}$. Moreover, the absorption probabilities vary slowly inside $\mathcal{S}$, while dropping sharply outside $\mathcal{S}$, thus implementing the desirable cluster assumption for graph-based learning. Remarkably, the partially absorbing process unifies many popular models arising in a variety of contexts, provides new insights into them, and makes it possible for transferring findings from one paradigm to another. Simulation results demonstrate its promising applications in graph-based learning."
1477,4236,2012,Modelling Reciprocating Relationships with Hawkes Processes,"We present a Bayesian nonparametric model that discovers implicit social structure from interaction time-series data. Social groups are often formed implicitly, through actions among members of groups. Yet many models of social networks use explicitly declared relationships to infer social structure. We consider a particular class of Hawkes processes, a doubly stochastic point process, that is able to model reciprocity between groups of individuals. We then extend the Infinite Relational Model by using these reciprocating Hawkes processes to parameterise its edges, making events associated with edges co-dependent through time. Our model outperforms general, unstructured Hawkes processes as well as structured Poisson process-based models at predicting verbal and email turn-taking, and military conflicts among nations."
1478,4237,2012,Mixability in Statistical Learning,"Statistical learning and sequential prediction are two different but related formalisms to study the quality of predictions. Mapping out their relations and transferring ideas is an active area of investigation. We provide another piece of the puzzle by showing that an important concept in sequential prediction, the mixability of a loss, has a natural counterpart in the statistical setting, which we call stochastic mixability. Just as ordinary mixability characterizes fast rates for the worst-case regret in sequential prediction, stochastic mixability characterizes fast rates in statistical learning. We show that, in the special case of log-loss, stochastic mixability reduces to a well-known (but usually unnamed) martingale condition, which is used in existing convergence theorems for minimum description length and Bayesian inference. In the case of 0/1-loss, it reduces to the margin condition of Mammen and Tsybakov, and in the case that the model under consideration contains all possible predictors, it is equivalent to ordinary mixability."
1479,4238,2012,Spectral learning of linear dynamics from generalised-linear observations with application to neural population data,"Latent linear dynamical systems with generalised-linear observation models arise in a variety of applications, for example when modelling the spiking activity of populations of neurons.  Here, we show how  spectral learning methods for linear systems with Gaussian observations   (usually called subspace identification in this context) can be extended to estimate the parameters of dynamical system models observed through non-Gaussian noise models. We use this approach to obtain estimates of parameters for a dynamical model of neural population data, where the observed spike-counts are Poisson-distributed with log-rates determined by the latent dynamical process, possibly driven by external inputs. We show that the extended system identification algorithm is consistent and accurately recovers the correct parameters on large simulated data sets with much smaller computational cost than approximate expectation-maximisation (EM) due to the non-iterative nature of subspace identification. Even on smaller data sets, it provides an effective initialization for EM, leading to more robust performance and faster convergence. These benefits are shown to extend to real neural data."
1480,4239,2012,Bayesian nonparametric models for bipartite graphs,"We develop a novel Bayesian nonparametric model for random bipartite graphs. The model is based on the theory of completely random measures and is able to handle a potentially infinite number of nodes. We show that the model has appealing properties and in particular it may exhibit a power-law behavior. We derive a posterior characterization, an Indian Buffet-like generative process for network growth, and a simple and efficient Gibbs sampler for posterior simulation. Our model is shown to be well fitted to several real-world social networks."
1481,4240,2012,Cocktail Party Processing via Structured Prediction,"While human listeners excel at selectively attending to a conversation in a cocktail party, machine performance is still far inferior by comparison. We show that the cocktail party problem, or the speech separation problem, can be effectively approached via structured prediction. To account for temporal dynamics in speech, we employ conditional random fields (CRFs) to classify speech dominance within each time-frequency unit for a sound mixture. To capture complex, nonlinear relationship between input and output, both state and transition feature functions in CRFs are learned by deep neural networks. The formulation of the problem as classification allows us to directly optimize a measure that is well correlated with human speech intelligibility. The proposed system substantially outperforms existing ones in a variety of noises."
1482,4241,2012,Slice sampling normalized kernel-weighted completely random measure mixture models,"A number of dependent nonparametric processes have been proposed to model non-stationary data with unknown latent dimensionality.  However, the inference algorithms are often slow and unwieldy, and are in general highly specific to a given model formulation. In this paper, we describe a wide class of nonparametric processes, including several existing models, and present a slice sampler that allows efficient inference across this class of models."
1483,4243,2012,Non-linear Metric Learning,"In this paper, we introduce two novel metric learning algorithms, ?2-LMNN and GB-LMNN, which are explicitly designed to be non-linear and  easy-to-use. The two approaches achieve this goal in fundamentally different ways: ?2-LMNN inherits the computational benefits of a linear mapping from linear metric learning, but uses a non-linear ?2-distance to explicitly capture similarities within histogram data sets; GB-LMNN applies gradient-boosting to learn non-linear mappings directly in function space and takes advantage of this approach's robustness, speed, parallelizability and insensitivity towards the single additional hyper-parameter. On various benchmark data sets, we demonstrate these methods not only match the current state-of-the-art in terms of kNN classification error, but in the case of ?2-LMNN, obtain best results in 19 out of 20 learning settings."
1484,4244,2012,The representer theorem for Hilbert spaces: a necessary and sufficient condition,"The representer theorem is a property that lies at the foundation of regularization theory and kernel methods. A class of regularization functionals is said to admit a linear representer theorem if every member of the class admits minimizers that lie in the finite dimensional subspace spanned by the representers of the data. A recent characterization states that certain classes of regularization functionals with differentiable regularization term admit a linear representer theorem for any choice of the data if and only if the regularization term is a radial nondecreasing function. In this paper, we extend such result by weakening the assumptions on the regularization term. In particular, the main result of this paper implies that, for a sufficiently large family of regularization functionals, radial nondecreasing functions are the only lower semicontinuous regularization terms that guarantee existence of a representer theorem for any choice of the data."
1485,4245,2012,Localizing 3D cuboids in single-view images,"In this paper we seek to detect rectangular cuboids and localize their corners in uncalibrated single-view images depicting everyday scenes. In contrast to recent approaches that rely on detecting vanishing points of the scene and grouping line segments to form cuboids, we build a discriminative parts-based detector that models the appearance of the cuboid corners and internal edges while enforcing consistency to a 3D cuboid model. Our model is invariant to the different 3D viewpoints and aspect ratios and is able to detect cuboids across many different object categories. We introduce a database of images with cuboid annotations that spans a variety of indoor and outdoor scenes and show qualitative and quantitative results on our collected database. Our model out-performs baseline detectors that use 2D constraints alone on the task of localizing cuboid corners."
1486,4246,2012,Nonparametric Reduced Rank Regression,"We propose an approach to multivariate nonparametric regression that generalizes reduced rank regression for linear models.  An additive model is estimated for each dimension of a $q$-dimensional response, with a shared $p$-dimensional predictor variable.  To control the complexity of the model, we employ a functional form of the Ky-Fan or nuclear norm, resulting in a set of function estimates that have low rank.  Backfitting algorithms are derived and justified using a nonparametric form of the nuclear norm subdifferential.  Oracle inequalities on excess risk are derived that exhibit the scaling behavior of the procedure in the high dimensional setting.  The methods are illustrated on gene expression data."
1487,4247,2012,A new metric on the manifold of kernel matrices with application to matrix geometric means,"Symmetric positive definite (spd) matrices are remarkably pervasive in a multitude of scientific disciplines, including machine learning and optimization. We consider the fundamental task of measuring distances between two spd matrices; a task that is often nontrivial whenever an application demands the distance function to respect the non-Euclidean geometry of spd matrices. Unfortunately, typical non-Euclidean distance measures such as the Riemannian metric $\riem(X,Y)=\frob{\log(X\inv{Y})}$, are computationally demanding and also complicated to use. To allay some of these difficulties, we introduce a new metric on spd matrices: this metric not only respects non-Euclidean geometry, it also offers faster computation than $\riem$ while being less complicated to use. We support our claims theoretically via a series of theorems that relate our metric to $\riem(X,Y)$, and experimentally by studying the nonconvex problem of computing matrix geometric means based on squared distances."
1488,4248,2012,Clustering by Nonnegative Matrix Factorization Using Graph Random Walk,"Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a promising relaxation technique for clustering analysis.  However, conventional NMF methods that directly approximate the pairwise similarities using the least square error often yield mediocre performance for data in curved manifolds because they can capture only the immediate similarities between data samples.  Here we propose a new NMF clustering method which replaces the approximated matrix with its smoothed version using random walk.  Our method can thus accommodate farther relationships between data samples.  Furthermore, we introduce a novel regularization in the proposed objective function in order to improve over spectral clustering.  The new learning objective is optimized by a multiplicative Majorization-Minimization algorithm with a scalable implementation for learning the factorizing matrix.  Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets show that our method has strong performance in terms of cluster purity."
1489,4249,2012,Isotropic Hashing,"Most existing hashing methods adopt some projection functions to project the original data into several dimensions of real values, and then each of these projected dimensions is quantized into one bit (zero or one) by thresholding. Typically, the variances of different projected dimensions are different for existing projection functions such as principal component analysis (PCA). Using the same number of bits for different projected dimensions is unreasonable because larger-variance dimensions will carry more information. Although this viewpoint has been widely accepted by many researchers, it is still not verified by either theory or experiment because no methods have been proposed to find a projection with equal variances for different dimensions. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called isotropic hashing (IsoHash), to learn projection functions which can produce projected dimensions with isotropic variances (equal variances). Experimental results on real data sets show that IsoHash can outperform its counterpart with different variances for different dimensions, which verifies the viewpoint that projections with isotropic variances will be better than those with anisotropic variances."
1490,4250,2012,Super-Bit Locality-Sensitive Hashing,"Sign-random-projection locality-sensitive hashing (SRP-LSH) is a probabilistic dimension reduction method which provides an unbiased estimate of angular similarity, yet suffers from the large variance of its estimation. In this work, we propose the Super-Bit locality-sensitive hashing (SBLSH). It is easy to implement, which orthogonalizes the random projection vectors in batches, and it is theoretically guaranteed that SBLSH also provides an unbiased estimate of angular similarity, yet with a smaller variance when the angle to estimate is within $(0,\pi/2]$. The extensive experiments on real data well validate that given the same length of binary code, SBLSH may achieve significant mean squared error reduction in estimating pairwise angular similarity. Moreover, SBLSH shows the superiority over SRP-LSH in approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) retrieval experiments."
1491,4251,2012,Learning Image Descriptors with the Boosting-Trick,"In this paper we  apply   boosting  to  learn   complex  non-linear  local   visual  feature representations, drawing  inspiration from its successful  application to visual object detection. The main  goal of  local feature descriptors  is to distinctively  represent a salient image  region while remaining invariant to  viewpoint and illumination changes. This representation can  be improved using machine learning, however, past approaches  have been mostly limited to learning  linear feature mappings in either the original input or a  kernelized input feature space.  While kernelized  methods have proven somewhat effective for learning non-linear local  feature descriptors,  they rely heavily  on the choice  of an appropriate kernel  function whose selection is often  difficult and non-intuitive. We propose  to use the boosting-trick  to  obtain a  non-linear  mapping  of  the input  to  a high-dimensional feature space. The non-linear feature mapping  obtained with the  boosting-trick is  highly intuitive. We employ gradient-based weak learners resulting in a learned descriptor that closely resembles the well-known SIFT. As demonstrated in our experiments, the resulting descriptor   can  be  learned   directly  from   intensity  patches  achieving state-of-the-art performance."
1492,4252,2012,Learning with Target Prior,"In the conventional approaches for supervised parametric learning, relations between data and target variables are provided through training sets consisting of pairs of corresponded data and target variables. In this work, we describe a new learning scheme for parametric learning, in which the target variables $\y$ can be modeled with a prior model $p(\y)$ and the relations between data and target variables are estimated through $p(\y)$ and a set of uncorresponded data $\x$ in training. We term this method as learning with target priors (LTP). Specifically, LTP learning seeks parameter $\t$ that maximizes the log likelihood of $f_\t(\x)$ on a uncorresponded training set with regards to $p(\y)$. Compared to the conventional (semi)supervised learning approach, LTP can make efficient use of prior knowledge of the target variables in the form of probabilistic distributions, and thus removes/reduces the reliance on training data in learning. Compared to the Bayesian approach, the learned parametric regressor in LTP can be more efficiently implemented and deployed in tasks where running efficiency is critical, such as on-line BCI signal decoding. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on parametric regression tasks for BCI signal decoding and pose estimation from video."
1493,4254,2012,A Marginalized Particle Gaussian Process Regression,"We present a novel marginalized particle Gaussian process (MPGP) regression, which provides a fast, accurate online Bayesian filtering framework to model the latent function. Using a state space model established by the data construction procedure, our MPGP recursively filters out the estimation of hidden function values by a Gaussian mixture. Meanwhile, it provides a new online method for training hyperparameters with a number of weighted particles. We demonstrate the estimated performance of our MPGP on both simulated and real large data sets. The results show that our MPGP is a robust estimation algorithm with high computational efficiency, which outperforms other state-of-art sparse GP methods."
1494,4255,2012,Learning Mixtures of Tree Graphical Models,"We consider  unsupervised estimation of mixtures of discrete graphical models, where the class variable   is hidden and each mixture component  can have a potentially different Markov graph structure and parameters over the observed variables. We propose a novel method for estimating the mixture components with  provable guarantees.   Our output is   a tree-mixture model which serves as a good approximation to the underlying graphical model mixture. The   sample and computational requirements for our method scale as $\poly(p,  r)$,   for an $r$-component mixture of $p$-variate graphical models, for a wide class of models which includes tree mixtures and mixtures over bounded degree graphs."
1495,4256,2012,Link Prediction in Graphs with Autoregressive Features,"In the paper, we consider the problem of link prediction in time-evolving graphs. We assume that certain graph features, such as the node degree, follow a vector autoregressive (VAR) model and we propose to use this information to improve the accuracy of prediction. Our strategy involves a joint optimization procedure over the space of adjacency matrices and VAR matrices which takes into account both sparsity and low rank properties of the matrices. Oracle inequalities are derived and illustrate the trade-offs in the choice of smoothing parameters when modeling the joint effect of sparsity and low rank property. The estimate is computed efficiently using proximal methods through a generalized forward-backward agorithm."
1496,4257,2012,Small-Variance Asymptotics for Exponential Family Dirichlet Process Mixture Models,"Links between probabilistic and non-probabilistic learning algorithms can arise by performing small-variance asymptotics, i.e., letting the variance of particular distributions in a graphical model go to zero. For instance, in the context of clustering, such an approach yields precise connections between the k-means and EM algorithms.  In this paper, we explore small-variance asymptotics for exponential family Dirichlet process (DP) and hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) mixture models.  Utilizing connections between exponential family distributions and Bregman divergences, we derive novel clustering algorithms from the asymptotic limit of the DP and HDP mixtures that feature the scalability of existing hard clustering methods as well as the flexibility of Bayesian nonparametric models.  We focus on special cases of our analysis for discrete-data problems, including topic modeling, and we demonstrate the utility of our results by applying variants of our algorithms to problems arising in vision and document analysis."
1497,4258,2012,Transferring Expectations in Model-based Reinforcement Learning,"We study how to automatically select and adapt multiple abstractions or representations of the world to support model-based reinforcement learning. We address the challenges of transfer learning in heterogeneous environments with varying tasks. We present an efficient, online framework that, through a sequence of tasks, learns a set of relevant representations to be used in future tasks. Without pre-defined mapping strategies, we introduce a general approach to support transfer learning across different state spaces. We demonstrate the potential impact of our system through improved jumpstart and faster convergence to near optimum policy in two benchmark domains."
1498,4259,2012,Majorization for CRFs and Latent Likelihoods,"The partition function plays a key role in probabilistic modeling including conditional random fields, graphical models, and maximum likelihood estimation. To optimize partition functions, this article introduces a quadratic variational upper bound. This inequality facilitates majorization methods: optimization of complicated functions through the iterative solution of simpler sub-problems. Such bounds remain efficient to compute even when the partition function involves a graphical model (with small tree-width) or in latent likelihood settings. For large-scale problems, low-rank versions of the bound are provided and outperform LBFGS as well as first-order methods. Several learning applications are shown and reduce to fast and convergent update rules. Experimental results show advantages over state-of-the-art optimization methods."
1499,4260,2012,Probabilistic Event Cascades for Alzheimer's disease,"Accurate and detailed models of the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as  Alzheimer's (AD) are crucially important for reliable early diagnosis and the determination and deployment of effective treatments. In this paper, we introduce the ALPACA (Alzheimer's disease Probabilistic Cascades) model, a generative model linking latent Alzheimer's progression dynamics to observable biomarker data. In contrast with previous works which model disease progression as a fixed ordering of events, we explicitly model the variability over such orderings among patients which is more realistic, particularly for highly detailed disease progression models. We describe efficient learning algorithms for ALPACA and discuss promising experimental results on a real cohort of Alzheimer's patients from the  Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative."
1500,4261,2013,Scalable Influence Estimation in Continuous-Time Diffusion Networks,"If a piece of information is released from a media site, can it spread, in 1 month, to a million web pages? This influence estimation problem is very challenging since both the time-sensitive nature of the problem and the issue of scalability need to be addressed simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a randomized algorithm for influence estimation in continuous-time diffusion networks. Our algorithm can estimate the influence of every node in a network with $|\Vcal|$ nodes and $|\Ecal|$ edges to an accuracy of $\epsilon$ using  $n=O(1/\epsilon^2)$ randomizations and up to logarithmic factors $O(n|\Ecal|+n|\Vcal|)$ computations. When used as a subroutine in a greedy influence maximization algorithm, our proposed method is guaranteed to find a set of nodes with an influence of at least $(1 - 1/e)\operatorname{OPT} - 2\epsilon$, where $\operatorname{OPT}$ is the optimal value. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that the proposed method can easily scale up to networks of millions of nodes while significantly improves over previous state-of-the-arts in terms of the accuracy of the estimated influence and the quality of the selected nodes in maximizing the influence."
